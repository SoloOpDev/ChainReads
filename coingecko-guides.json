The $2 Trillion Opportunity</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-stablecoin-chains\" target=\"_blank\">stablechain</a> is a blockchain built specifically for stablecoins, and is one of the top growing narratives of 2025 as outlined in our <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/most-popular-crypto-narratives\" target=\"_blank\">crypto narratives report</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tempo, much like many other upcoming/current L1s, is trying to establish itself in the extremely competitive emerging market of stablechains. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent <a href=\"https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/citi-says-stablecoin-chatgpt-moment-to-drive-surge-four-tn-usd/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">has stated</a> that he believes stablecoins represent a massive market opportunity that could reach a market capitalization of over $2 trillion. With the backing of major institutions such as Stripe, Tempo is considered by many to be one of the top contenders in the stablechain space.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why Stablecoins Matter for Payments</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that maintain a stable price through various methods, the most common method is for stablecoins to be backed by a fiat currency such as the US dollar. Stablecoins solve several critical problems in traditional finance:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Speed: </strong>Traditional bank transfers, especially international ones, can take 3-5 business days. Stablecoin transfers settle in seconds or minutes.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Cost: </strong>International wire transfers can sometimes cost $30-50 and include hidden foreign exchange fees. Cross-border stablecoin transfers will cost pennies in comparison.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Stablecoins work 24/7 all year-round with transactions finalized near instantaneously, while traditional banking systems close on weekends, holidays and are sometimes subject to delayed settlement (T+1, +2, etc.).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Programmability: </strong>Stablecoins can be integrated into software applications, enabling automated payments, smart contracts, and innovative financial services.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"what-makes-tempo-unique-as-a-stablechain\">What Makes Tempo Unique as a Stablechain?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tempo enters a rapidly evolving landscape of payment-focused blockchains. While it faces emerging competition from projects like Circle's Arc blockchain, Stable's StableChain and many others, Tempo distinguishes itself through several key advantages:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Strong industry backing:</strong> Backed by Stripe's 15 years of payments expertise and Paradigm's blockchain knowledge.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Elite partnerships:</strong> Design input from category-defining companies including OpenAI, Shopify, Mastercard, UBS, Visa, Deutsche Bank, Revolut, Nubank, and many others — representing companies that collectively serve billions of users worldwide.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Comprehensive ecosystem:</strong> Over 40 infrastructure partners including wallet providers (MetaMask, Phantom), interoperability protocols (LayerZero, Across), and developer tools.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://blockworks.co/news/tempo-series-a-raise\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tempo raised $500 million at a $5 billion valuation</a>, signaling strong institutional confidence in its payments-first approach. The project aims to capture a significant portion of the growing stablecoin economy, which the US Treasury Secretary has suggested could reach $2 trillion in market capitalization.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Tempo Features</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are some of the defining features Tempo has, which&nbsp;differentiates itself from the competition.</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Dedicated Payment Lanes</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of Tempo's most innovative features is dedicated payment lanes — guaranteed blockspace (the computational capacity needed to process transactions) reserved specifically for payment transactions at the protocol level.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On general-purpose blockchains, a payment transaction competes with all other network activity: NFT mints, DeFi liquidations, high-frequency trading bots, and everything else. When an NFT collection launches or a popular protocol experiences high activity, transaction fees can spike 10x or even 100x, making payments economically unviable.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tempo's dedicated payment lanes ensure that stablecoin transfers always have priority access to blockspace, keeping fees predictably low (targeting one-tenth of a cent per transaction) regardless of other network activity. It's like having a carpool lane on the highway that guarantees you won't get stuck in traffic, even when the regular lanes are gridlocked.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Stablecoin-Native Gas Fees</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On most blockchains, you need the network's native token to pay transaction fees (called \"gas\"). On Ethereum, you need ETH. On Solana, you need SOL. These tokens are volatile — their price can swing 20% in a day — making it difficult for businesses to budget costs and requiring users to hold multiple different cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tempo allows you to pay gas fees directly in any supported USD-denominated stablecoins like USDC or USDT. If you're a business sending payroll in USDC, you simply pay the tiny transaction fee in USDC too. There's no need to acquire, hold, or manage a volatile token just to facilitate payments. This dramatically simplifies accounting, reduces operational complexity, and ensures predictable costs.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Built-In Stablecoin DEX</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tempo includes a native decentralized exchange (DEX) optimized specifically for stablecoins and tokenized deposits (bank-issued digital representations of deposits). The built-in DEX enables seamless conversion between different stablecoins. If you want to pay gas in USDT but the validator prefers to receive USDC, the protocol automatically converts it using the DEX's liquidity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Users and businesses can transact in whatever stablecoin they prefer, while validators receive payment in their preferred stablecoin — all handled transparently by the protocol.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">EVM Compatibility</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tempo is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible, meaning developers can use the same programming languages (Solidity), tools (Foundry, Hardhat), and frameworks they use on Ethereum. Existing smart contracts can be deployed on Tempo with minimal or no modification.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This compatibility is built on Paradigm's high-performance Ethereum client Reth, which provides the technical foundation for Tempo's optimized architecture while maintaining familiar development workflows.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Modern Authentication and User Experience</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tempo includes built-in support for:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Passkeys: </strong>Modern authentication using biometrics (fingerprint, face recognition) instead of complex seed phrases.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Gas sponsorship: </strong>Allowing businesses to pay transaction fees on behalf of users, creating smoother experiences.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Batch transactions:</strong> Multiple operations bundled into single transactions for efficiency.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Scheduled payments: </strong>Programmable future payments without manual intervention.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These features lower the technical barrier for mainstream users and enable businesses to create payment experiences that feel like traditional apps, not crypto experiments.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"the-tempo-testnet\">The Tempo Testnet</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A testnet is a testing environment where developers can experiment with blockchain features in a safe environment before the network launches officially (mainnet). Think of it as a flight simulator for pilots —&nbsp; a safe environment to practice before operating with real stakes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tempo's public testnet launched on December 9, 2025, opening access to developers worldwide. Here's what's currently available:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Run a node: </strong>Anyone can download the Tempo client (available as pre-built binaries, Docker images, or built from source) and run a node to validate transactions and sync the chain.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Deploy smart contracts: </strong>Developers can deploy and test Solidity smart contracts using familiar Ethereum tools like Foundry, Hardhat, and Remix.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Create custom stablecoins: </strong>Users can create their own stablecoin directly from a web browser, experimenting with token issuance and management.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Test payment flows:</strong> Developers can simulate payment scenarios including transfers, batch payments, scheduled payments, and cross-stablecoin transactions.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Access testnet stablecoins: </strong>Tempo provides a faucet where developers can claim free testnet tokens to experiment with various features.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Explore the built-in DEX:</strong> While there is no front-end for the DEX as of writing, developers may experiment with interacting with <a href=\"https://docs.tempo.xyz/protocol/exchange/spec\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the swap contracts</a> directly.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The testnet as of writing, is geared towards developers with little interactions available for the average retail investor. However, that is expected to change over the coming months as Tempo continues to add features, implement front-ends, and stress test their network before an eventual mainnet launch.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"risks-and-considerations\">Risks and Considerations</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While Tempo offers significant potential, users and developers should be aware of several important risks:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Early-stage technology: </strong>Tempo is currently in testnet and has not been proven under real-world conditions with significant economic value at stake. Bugs or vulnerabilities may be discovered before or after mainnet launch.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Centralization concerns:</strong> The testnet currently operates with only four validators run by the Tempo team, which is highly centralized compared to established networks like Ethereum. The transition to a permissionless validator set will take time.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Smart contract risks:</strong> Poorly written or malicious smart contracts could result in loss of funds. Users should verify contracts are audited by reputable security firms and only use protocols with established track records.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Competition and adoption: </strong>Despite impressive backing, there's no guarantee Tempo will achieve meaningful adoption or that its economic model will prove sustainable long-term.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tempo represents a significant evolution in blockchain design — moving from general-purpose networks toward specialized infrastructure built for specific use cases. By focusing exclusively on stablecoin payments and incorporating features that businesses actually need (dedicated blockspace, predictable costs, instant settlement, payment metadata), Tempo addresses many pain points that have prevented mainstream blockchain adoption for financial applications.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Backed by Stripe's payment expertise and Paradigm's blockchain knowledge, with input from some of the world's leading financial institutions and technology companies, Tempo has the potential to become critical infrastructure for the growing stablecoin economy — an economy that may reach $2 trillion in the coming years.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>This article is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed as financial or investment advice. Tempo is an early-stage blockchain project, and participation involves significant risks including potential loss of funds, smart contract vulnerabilities, regulatory uncertainty, and no guarantee of success.</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"tw-text-lg md:tw-text-2xl tw-font-bold tw-text-gray-900 dark:tw-text-white dark:tw-text-opacity-87\">\n  More Articles\n</h3>"

Think of your Solana wallet like an apartment building you own, and each different cryptocurrency you hold is like a separate storage unit inside that building. On Ethereum, it's as if all your belongings are stored directly in your main apartment. But on Solana, each different token type gets its own dedicated storage unit (token account) within your building (wallet).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A token account is a data structure on the Solana blockchain that holds a specific type of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/spl-solana-token-standards\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SPL token</a> (Solana Program Library token, which is Solana's token standard similar to ERC-20 on Ethereum). Your main wallet (called a System Account) doesn't directly hold tokens — instead, it owns and manages multiple token accounts, each designed to hold one specific type of token.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here's a concrete example: If you own SOL, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usdc\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">USDC</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bonk\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BONK</a> tokens, you'll have:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Your main wallet (System Account) that holds native SOL.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">A token account specifically for USDC.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">A token account specifically for BONK.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Plus additional accounts for any other SPL tokens you've received.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This might seem unnecessarily complicated compared to Ethereum, but there's a good reason for this design.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"why-does-solana-use-this-account-model\">Why Does Solana Use This Account Model?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solana's account model serves a critical purpose: speed and parallel processing. Because each token account is a separate data structure with its own address, Solana's validators (the computers that process transactions) can process multiple token transfers simultaneously without conflicts. Think of it like having multiple checkout lines at a grocery store instead of just one — more transactions can happen at the same time.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This architecture enables Solana to achieve its famously high transaction throughput (the number of transactions the network can process per second), often handling thousands of transactions per second compared to Ethereum's dozens.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, this design comes with a trade-off: rent deposits.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"the-rent-deposit-system-your-sol-security-deposit\">The Rent Deposit System: Your SOL Security Deposit</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here's where things get interesting for your wallet balance. On Solana, storing data on the blockchain requires what's called a rent deposit — a small amount of SOL that must be locked in each account to keep it active on the network.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Think of rent deposits like security deposits when you rent an apartment. You pay money upfront that's held in escrow (kept aside as a guarantee), and you get it back when you move out and return the apartment in good condition. Similarly, when a token account is created for you, a small amount of SOL (currently around 0.002 SOL) is deposited into that account to \"reserve its space\" on the blockchain.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here's the important part: <strong>you get this deposit back when you close the account.</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The term \"rent\" is somewhat misleading because you're not actually paying ongoing fees — it's a one-time deposit that you can fully reclaim. Solana introduced a concept called rent-exempt status, meaning as long as an account maintains a minimum balance (the rent deposit), it can exist on the blockchain indefinitely without any additional payments.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"how-token-accounts-impact-your-wallet\">How Token Accounts Impact Your Wallet</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For most casual users, token accounts work invisibly in the background. When you receive a new type of token for the first time, a token account is automatically created for you (either by the sender or by your wallet software). However, this automation can lead to an interesting situation: unclaimed SOL.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let's say you've been active in the Solana ecosystem for a year. You might have:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Bought and sold various tokens/memecoins.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Received airdropped tokens from new projects.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Swapped between different stablecoins.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Collected NFTs (each NFT is technically a unique token).</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each of these activities may have created a token account. If you interacted with 50 different tokens, you could have 50 token accounts, each holding approximately 0.0020 SOL in rent deposits. That's roughly 0.1 SOL locked away (worth around $15-20 depending on SOL's price) — not a fortune, but certainly worth reclaiming.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Many users don't realize this SOL is sitting there because:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Even if you have fully sold the token, the account is not automatically closed.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The rent deposits happen automatically in the background.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Wallet interfaces typically show your \"available balance\" which excludes rent deposits.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Empty token accounts (accounts with zero token balance but still holding the rent deposit) remain open indefinitely unless manually closed.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"what-is-unclaimed-sol\">What Is Unclaimed SOL?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unclaimed SOL refers to the rent deposits locked in token accounts that you no longer actively use. These are typically accounts that either:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Hold zero tokens (you sold or transferred all tokens out).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Hold \"dust\" (tiny fractional amounts of tokens worth essentially nothing).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Were created for tokens from failed or abandoned projects.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Think of unclaimed SOL like loose change scattered across old wallets, forgotten gift cards, or security deposits from apartments you moved out of years ago but never collected. The money is technically yours, but it's locked in places you're no longer checking.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The reason this SOL is \"unclaimed\" rather than automatically returned is by design — Solana's protocol doesn't automatically delete accounts because doing so could cause unexpected issues for programs (smart contracts) that expect those accounts to exist. Instead, users must manually choose to close accounts and reclaim their deposits.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"how-to-access-your-unclaimed-sol\">How to Access Your Unclaimed SOL</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fortunately, reclaiming your SOL is straightforward using specialized tools designed for this purpose. A popular option is Sol Incinerator, but several alternatives exist.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Using Sol Incinerator</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sol Incinerator is a free tool that scans your wallet for empty or nearly-empty token accounts and allows you to close them in bulk, returning the rent deposits to your main wallet.</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<div dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Connect your wallet: Visit <a href=\"https://sol-incinerator.com/profile\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Sol Incinerator</a> and connect your Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare, etc.).<img alt=\"sol incinerator wallet connect\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34431/content_sol_incinerator_wallet_connect.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 686px;\">\n</div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<div dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Scan for accounts: The tool automatically scans your wallet and identifies token accounts that can be closed — typically those with zero balance or minimal dust.&nbsp;<img alt=\"sol incinerator vacant wallet\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34432/content_sol_incinerator_vacant_wallets.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 589px;\">\n</div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Review the list: For this example, we will focus on closing vacant accounts (cleanup section), more can be reclaimed on the other sections but caution has to be taken when closing those (more on this later).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<div dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Close accounts: Sign the transaction and close the accounts. In this example, 167 vacant accounts have been detected, allowing 0.3339 SOL to be reclaimed.&nbsp;<img alt=\"sol incinerator vacant wallet simulation\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34433/content_sol_incinerator_vacant_wallet_simulation.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 626px;\">\n</div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Receive your SOL: The rent deposits are immediately returned to your main wallet.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Closing Other Token Accounts</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mentioned earlier, you can also reclaim SOL from the other sections, we will cover that in greater detail and the pitfalls that you should be aware of.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">The “Tokens” Section&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"sol incinerator token section\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34434/content_burning_of_fake_figure.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 664px;\">\n</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In this section, SOL from existing token accounts can be reclaimed (non-zero balance).&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This allows you to be able to reclaim SOL from tokens you have mostly sold but still have some miniscule amounts remaining. For instance, in the above example, 35 FIGURE worth less than $0.01 still exists in this wallet. Burning the leftover amounts can allow us to reclaim more than what we will lose from burning the remaining 35 FIGURE.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, more importantly, users are able to burn honeypot scam tokens, often airdropped to user wallets with the token rent deposit being paid for by the scammer. Burning these scam tokens, which are often tokens trying to mimic as real tokens, allow us to actually “profit” from these scammers.</p>\n<img src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34435/content_fake_ani_tokens.webp\" alt=\"burning fake ANI tokens\" />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, extreme caution has to be taken here, users must ensure that the tokens they have marked for burn are not of importance as this action is irreversible. While Sol Incinerator has filter systems in place, users must triple check to make sure that they are not burning the actual token holdings of their own wallet.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">NFTs, CNFTs and Domains</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The same concept as the “Tokens” section apply, users can mark irrelevant or unwanted NFTs for burn to reclaim the rent deposit amounts.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Other Solana Token Account Managers</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beyond Sol Incinerator, you can also use:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Solana Token Account Manager by Step Finance:</strong> Part of Step Finance's portfolio management tools, this allows you to view and manage your token accounts.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Manual closure via Solana CLI:</strong> For advanced users comfortable with command-line interfaces, you can use Solana's official command-line tools to close accounts individually.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Wallet built-in features:</strong> Some wallets like Phantom have started integrating token account management directly into their interfaces.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Important Considerations</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before closing token accounts, keep these points in mind:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Don't close accounts you're still using: </strong>If a token account holds any tokens you want to keep, closing it would destroy those tokens.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Transaction fees apply: </strong>While small (usually a fraction of a cent), you'll pay network fees to close accounts.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Some accounts can't be closed: </strong>Accounts associated with certain programs or with non-zero balances won't be closeable through these tools.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Recreating costs the same:</strong> If you close an account for a token you later want to use again, you'll pay the same rent deposit to recreate it.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solana's token account system represents a fundamental architectural difference from Ethereum and other blockchains. While it adds a layer of complexity — requiring separate accounts for each token type and rent deposits to maintain them — this design enables Solana's impressive transaction speeds and low costs.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Understanding token accounts empowers you to:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Recognize where your SOL is actually stored.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Identify and reclaim unclaimed SOL from unused accounts.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Make informed decisions about when to close accounts versus keeping them active.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Better understand the true cost structure of using Solana.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For most users, the practical takeaway is simple: periodically check for unclaimed SOL using tools like Sol Incinerator, especially if you've been active in the Solana ecosystem. Those small rent deposits can add up, and there's no reason to leave your SOL locked away when it could be in your active balance.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As Solana continues to evolve, wallet interfaces are becoming better at surfacing this information and making account management more intuitive.

This would mark Ethereum’s latest upgrade since the Pectra Upgrade which took place in May 2025.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following Ethereum's naming convention, \"Fusaka\" combines two upgrade names: \"Fulu\" (for the consensus layer, named after a star) and \"Osaka\" (for the execution layer, named after the Japanese city that will host Devcon 2025, an Ethereum convention event).&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Where Fusaka Fits in Ethereum's Roadmap</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To understand Fusaka's importance, it helps to see where it sits in Ethereum's evolution:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>The Merge (2022):</strong> Transitioned Ethereum from energy-intensive proof-of-work to efficient proof-of-stake</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Shanghai/Shapella (2023):</strong> Enabled validators to withdraw their staked ETH</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Dencun (March 2024):</strong> Introduced \"blobs\" (temporary data storage packets) that reduced Layer 2 fees by 90-95%.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Pectra (May 2025): </strong>Increased blob capacity and improved validator flexibility.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Fusaka (December 2025): </strong>Dramatically scales data availability through PeerDAS and prepares Ethereum for 100,000+ TPS.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each upgrade builds on the previous one. Dencun introduced the concept of blobs — think of them as temporary storage containers where Layer 2 networks can post transaction data cheaply. Fusaka takes this concept much further by introducing a smarter way for the network to verify this data exists without every validator needing to download everything.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"core-technical-improvements-explained-simply\">Core Technical Improvements Explained Simply</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fusaka includes approximately 12-13 Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs — formal proposals for changes to Ethereum). While that sounds technical, the key improvements fall into a few understandable categories.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">PeerDAS: Fusaka’s Main Feature</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling, defined in EIP-7594) is Fusaka's headline feature and represents a fundamental shift in how Ethereum handles data.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Problem It Solves: Currently, when Layer 2 networks like Arbitrum or Optimism post their transaction data to Ethereum (in those blob containers we mentioned), every validator needs to download the complete data to verify it's available. This creates a bottleneck — if blobs get too big or too numerous, validators need expensive hardware with high bandwidth to keep up.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Solution: Create a system where network validators are not required to download entire blobs of data, but instead just need small samples of these blobs for verification.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Imagine a library where instead of reading an entire book to confirm it's complete and undamaged, you could randomly check a few pages. If enough people check different random pages and they all look good, you can be confident the whole book is intact. That's essentially what PeerDAS does.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With PeerDAS, validators only need to download approximately 12.5% of the blob data — they sample random portions and share that information with peers. Through mathematical techniques called \"erasure coding\" (which adds redundancy to data, like a sophisticated backup system), the network can reconstruct the full data from just 50% of the pieces. This means:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Validators need 85% less bandwidth compared to downloading everything.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Storage requirements drop significantly for individual nodes.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The network can safely support many more blobs without overwhelming validators.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Home stakers can continue participating without needing enterprise-grade internet connections.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Think of it this way: instead of everyone at a concert recording the entire show, a few people record different parts, and if you need the full concert later, you can piece it together from everyone's recordings.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Block Gas Limit Increase: Enabling More Complex Transactions</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Gas is Ethereum's measure of computational work — every transaction and smart contract operation consumes a certain amount of gas. The gas limit determines how much computation can fit in a single block.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EIP-7935 increases Ethereum's default block gas limit from approximately 36 million to 60 million gas units. This 67% increase means:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">More transactions can be processed on Ethereum's main network (Layer 1).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Complex smart contracts have more room to execute without running into limits.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Network throughput improves even before considering Layer 2 benefits.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, bigger blocks mean validators must process more data. To make sure the network is not overwhelmed, Fusaka also introduces several safety measures such as a block size cap (EIP-7934) and a transaction gas cap (EIP-7825).&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">EVM Improvements and New Features</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the computer that executes all smart contracts throughout Ethereum and its Layer 2s. Fusaka includes several enhancements:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EVM Object Format (EOF): </strong>Think of this as a cleaner, more efficient programming structure for smart contracts. It separates code from data more clearly, making contracts easier to validate and optimize. For developers, this means faster execution and fewer errors.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>New Opcodes (EIP-7742):</strong> Opcodes are basic instructions the EVM can execute (like ADD, SUBTRACT, or STORE). Fusaka adds a CLZ (count leading zeros) opcode that makes certain cryptographic operations more efficient. While this sounds niche, it helps with tasks like verifying digital signatures and processing cryptographic proofs.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>secp256r1 Support (EIP-7212):</strong> This adds support for a different type of digital signature that's commonly used in mobile devices and hardware security modules. Practically, this means you could eventually use your iPhone's Face ID or fingerprint sensor to interact with Ethereum apps instead of managing a seed phrase — making crypto more accessible and secure for everyday users.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"why-fusaka-matters-the-big-picture\">Why Fusaka Matters: The Big Picture</h2>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Enabling True Layer 2 Scaling</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most significant impact of Fusaka is what it enables for Layer 2 rollups — separate blockchains like Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and zkSync that bundle thousands of transactions together and post summaries to Ethereum for security.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Current State: After the Dencun upgrade in March 2024, Layer 2 fees dropped from $0.50-$3.00 to around $0.01-$0.10 per transaction — a massive improvement. However, these L2s are already filling up the available blob space during peak usage.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After Fusaka, Layer 2 networks will have:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">3.5x more space to post transaction data.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">40-60% lower costs as blob fees decrease due to increased supply.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Capacity to handle 100,000+ transactions per second across the entire L2 ecosystem (compared to roughly 12,000 TPS estimates pre-Fusaka).</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To put this in perspective, Visa processes about 65,000 TPS on average. Ethereum's Layer 2 ecosystem post-Fusaka could theoretically exceed this, while maintaining the security and decentralization of Ethereum's base layer.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Blob Fee Reserve Mechanism</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fusaka also has several implications on transaction fees during periods of network congestion. EIP-7918 introduces a blob fee reserve system that changes how blob pricing works.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Instead of blob fees fluctuating wildly based on immediate demand (like gas prices do), excess blob fees get stored in a \"reserve.\" When demand spikes and blob fees rise rapidly, the reserve automatically releases fees back into circulation to smooth out price volatility. When demand is low, fees accumulate in the reserve.</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">More predictable costs for Layer 2 networks.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Better user experience as L2 fees become more stable.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Reduced Validator Requirements</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For people running Ethereum validators (the computers that secure the Ethereum network by validating transactions), Fusaka brings welcome relief:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Bandwidth Reduction:</strong> PeerDAS cuts the amount of data validators need to download by approximately 85%. If a validator previously needed to download 750 MB of blob data per day, they'd now only need around 112 MB.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Storage Optimization: </strong>While validators still need to store blob data temporarily (blobs are kept for about 18 days), the ability to sample data means they don't need to store everything permanently.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Decentralization Benefits:</strong> Lower requirements mean more people can run validators from home without needing enterprise-grade internet connections. This strengthens decentralization — one of Ethereum's core values.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"impact-of-the-fusaka-upgrade\">Impact of the Fusaka Upgrade</h2>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Regular ETH Holders</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even if you just hold ETH and occasionally make transactions, Fusaka impacts you:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Cheaper L2 Transactions:</strong> If you use Layer 2 networks for trading, NFTs, or DeFi, your transaction costs will decrease by an estimated 40-60%. That $0.05 transaction might drop to $0.02-$0.03.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Improved Network Performance:</strong> With higher throughput and more efficient data handling, the entire Ethereum ecosystem becomes smoother and more reliable.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">DeFi Users</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you participate in decentralized finance — lending, borrowing, trading on DEXs, or providing liquidity:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Faster, Cheaper Interactions:</strong> Complex DeFi operations on Layer 2 networks will become more affordable. Yield farming strategies that were uneconomical at $0.10 per transaction might make sense at $0.02.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>More Sophisticated Decentralized Applications: </strong>The increased gas limit and EOF improvements enable more complex smart contracts, potentially leading to innovative DeFi products that weren't previously possible.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Developers</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For those building on Ethereum:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Improved EVM:</strong> The EOF enhancements make smart contracts easier to write, test, and optimize. Code separation improves security and reduces bugs.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>New Tools: </strong>The CLZ opcode and secp256r1 support open up new possibilities, particularly for cryptographic applications and mobile-friendly wallet experiences.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Scalability Infrastructure</strong>: With blob capacity expanding, developers can build applications that would have been throttled by data availability constraints under the old system.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Layer 2 Networks</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>For teams running rollups like Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, or zkSync:</strong></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Increased Capacity:</strong> The ability to post more data to Ethereum means these networks can process more transactions without hitting bottlenecks.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Lower Operating Costs:</strong> As blob fees stabilize and capacity increases, the cost of settling to Layer 1 decreases, savings that can be passed to users.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong> L2s that efficiently utilize the new blob space can offer the fastest and cheapest transactions, attracting more users and developers.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Validators and Node Operators</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For those securing the network:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Lower Barriers to Entry: </strong>Reduced bandwidth requirements mean the cost to set up a network validator decreases, potentially increasing the number of validators and node operators throughout the network.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Simplified Operations: </strong>The improvements to network protocols and deterministic block proposer selection (knowing in advance when you'll propose blocks) make validator operations more predictable.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"fusaka-s-potential-market-impact\">Fusaka’s Potential Market Impact</h2>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Institutional Interest</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Institutional adoption of Ethereum has been growing, and Fusaka could accelerate this trend:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Infrastructure Maturity:</strong> Major upgrades that execute successfully without network disruptions demonstrate Ethereum's technical maturity — a key consideration for institutions managing billions in assets.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Competitive Positioning: </strong>By significantly improving scalability while maintaining security and decentralization, Fusaka helps Ethereum defend against competitors like Solana that have traditionally emphasized speed over decentralization.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Strategic Importance</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beyond short-term price movements, Fusaka represents a strategic milestone:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Scalability Race: </strong>Competing blockchains like Solana, Avalanche, and newer L1s constantly improve their technology. Fusaka demonstrates Ethereum's ability to scale significantly while preserving decentralization.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Layer 2 Ecosystem Growth: </strong>With over 50% of DeFi value locked on Ethereum-related chains, scaling Layer 2s effectively expands Ethereum's addressable market without fragmenting liquidity.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Developer Retention: </strong>By consistently upgrading the EVM and providing better tools, Ethereum maintains its position as the preferred platform for serious developers, which drives long-term value.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"what-s-next-for-ethereum-after-fusaka\">What’s Next For Ethereum After Fusaka</h2>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Road Ahead: Glamsterdam</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After Fusaka, Ethereum's next major upgrade is tentatively called \"Glamsterdam\" (combining \"Glamour\" and \"Amsterdam,\" the city hosting a future Devcon), expected in 2026.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While specifics remain under discussion, the Ethereum roadmap continues with:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Surge (ongoing): </strong>Further scalability improvements beyond Fusaka, potentially including full Danksharding (the complete vision of which PeerDAS is just the first step).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Verge:</strong> Introducing Verkle Trees (partially included in Fusaka) to make nodes even lighter and enable \"stateless clients\" that can verify the chain without storing complete state.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Purge:</strong> Simplifying the protocol by removing historical data and technical debt, making Ethereum easier to run and maintain.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>The Splurge:</strong> Various improvements including account abstraction enhancements, MEV (miner extractable value) solutions, and cryptographic upgrades.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Long-Term Vision</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ethereum's ultimate goal remains unchanged: become a global settlement layer that's:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Scalable: </strong>Handle millions of transactions per second through Layer 2s</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Secure: </strong>Maintain robust security through thousands of independent validators</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Decentralized:</strong> Enable anyone to run a node or validator without prohibitive costs</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fusaka represents a major step toward this vision by proving that scalability and decentralization aren't mutually exclusive—you can have both through clever engineering like PeerDAS.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Fusaka upgrade marks a pivotal moment in Ethereum's continued development. By introducing PeerDAS, increasing the gas limit, and implementing numerous smaller improvements, Fusaka transforms Ethereum from a blockchain that can support some Layer 2 activity into one that can sustain a massive ecosystem of scaling solutions processing hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For everyday users, this means cheaper transactions and more responsive applications. For developers, it means better tools and the infrastructure to build more ambitious products. For validators, it means lower barriers to participation and a more sustainable network to secure. And for Ethereum as a whole, it means defending its position as the leading smart contract platform while staying true to its decentralization principles.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>This article is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice.

It lets them maintain flexibility, stay nimble, and take advantage of a greater degree of leverage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These contracts are popular in the cryptocurrency space given the significant price changes that can occur in the market. It is commonly used for tokens like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum</a>, but a new and developing category of protocols are offering synthetic perps for tracking non-crypto assets such as gold.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Perps vs. Traditional Futures Contracts</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Traditional futures contracts act as an agreement to buy or sell assets at a predetermined price at a specific time in the future. On the contrary, perps do not implement an expiration date and traders can hold their positions as long as they want.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are some other ways that perps and traditional futures contracts are different:</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Perps vs. Spot Trading</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-spot-trading\" target=\"_blank\">Spot trading</a> involves the immediate buying or selling of an asset at the current market price. It offers the most direct way to trade crypto and gives traders ownership of the asset as soon as the transaction is completed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another key differentiating factor is real-time pricing. Since crypto prices can swing continuously based on supply and demand, some traders might choose to capitalize on short-term price movements. The speed of spot trading allows them to make decisions and react to market changes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Spot trading also carries less risks since traders deal with the present value of a token, thus limiting their exposure to current market conditions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some other differences between perps and spot trading are:</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"how-perpetuals-work\">How Perpetuals Work</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are a number of mechanisms that support perpetual futures contracts, especially when it needs to be executed in a decentralized manner.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Funding Rate</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With traditional futures, the asset converges to the spot price upon expiry. Since perpetuals don’t have an expiration date, another mechanism is needed to keep prices close to the spot market. That is where the funding rate mechanism is applied.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The funding rate is a payment made at regular intervals — usually hourly — between traders to incentivize a balance in demand while ensuring that prices remain close to the asset’s spot price. For example, a negative rate means that there are more traders holding short positions. In this case, short positions will pay the funding fee to those with long positions. The same mechanism is applied in reverse if the rate is positive. Essentially, the funding rate is meant to help perpetual futures prices stay as close to spot prices as possible by incentivizing traders to open positions that are receiving the funding fee.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Leverage and Margin</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To open a position, traders need to deposit margin that acts as the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-collateral-defi?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">collateral</a>. This is typically made up of an initial margin and the maintenance margin which is used to cover losses without the platform liquidating the position.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After depositing margin, traders can choose to go long (betting prices go up) or short (betting prices go down) as well as their <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/leverage-crypto-trading-how-does-it-work?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">leverage</a>. A higher leverage allows them to control a larger trade position with a smaller capital. For example if a trader opens a 10x long BTC perp with a $1,000 margin. They will have control over a $10,000 position, and if the price moves up by 5% then they can gain 50% of their initial capital which comes up to $500.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Leverage lets traders dramatically increase profits but can also do the same to losses. Even small price movements in the opposite direction can lead to quick capital depletion and potential liquidations.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Liquidations</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/defi-liquidation-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Liquidation</a> occurs when a trader’s position no longer meets the required maintenance margin due to price movements. When this happens, the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent their balance from going negative. Do note that a liquidated position means losing the entire margin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The same position from the example above could be liquidated if the asset’s price dropped by 10% since that would result in the loss of the entire $1,000 margin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A position’s leverage and entry price will determine when liquidation happens. The higher the leverage, the smaller the liquidation distance. A 10x leveraged position would be liquidated with a 10% price swing, but a 40x leveraged position would be affected by a 2.5% swing.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"decentralized-perp-dexs\">Decentralized Perp DEXs</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A perpetual decentralized exchange (Perp DEX) uses blockchain technology to enable users to trade perps.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key Features</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Several building blocks are necessary to make perp trading possible.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Perpetual Contracts</strong>: These are derivatives without an expiry date that let traders hold positions indefinitely.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Non-custodial Trading</strong>: Users maintain control of their funds and can trade directly from their wallets.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Oracles</strong>: These provide real-time price feeds to keep contract prices aligned with spot markets.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Funding Rates</strong>: Periodic payments between traders to ensure perp prices track underlying asset prices.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Liquidity Models</strong>: Perp DEXs use <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/automated-market-makers-amms?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Automated Market Makers (AMMs)</a>, on-chain order books, or hybrid models to manage liquidity.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Risk Management</strong>: Smart contracts are used to enforce margin rules, liquidation, and occasionally insurance funds.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Governance and Tokenomics</strong>: Many platforms issue governance tokens to reward users and empower community decision-making.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Perp DEXs vs. Centralized Exchanges</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Traders can choose to use decentralized or centralized exchanges to perform perpetual futures transactions. However, there are a few differences in how these platforms work.</p>\n<p>Perp DEX volumes have been growing in 2025 and successfully reached a new record of $1 trillion in September. Platforms like Hyperliquid have been leading on-chain activities with some newer players throwing their hats in the ring. Meanwhile, futures volumes on centralized exchanges — largely made up of perpetuals — reached <a href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/2025-q3-crypto-industry-report-coingecko\" target=\"_blank\">$6.9 trillion in September</a> with heavyweights Binance and OKX at the top.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"strategies-for-trading-perps\">Strategies for Trading Perps</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before you start trading perps, it is best to learn more about the strategies that others might be using.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Beginner Friendly: Follow Market Trends</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The simplest method is to identify trends in the market and open positions based on that. This strategy is based on the market’s momentum and traders enter a position in the direction of the trend and exit when the trend reverses. Traders will need to stay updated with market movements and trends.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Intermediate: Hedge Existing Position in the Underlying Asset</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Perps can also be used to hedge an existing position in the underlying asset. This strategy is meant to offset any potential losses incurred from another perp position or even a spot market position. For example, if a trader has a Bitcoin long position but anticipates a short-term decline in price, they can open a short position that then gains value if the price of Bitcoin falls. The same can be applied to a trader who holds BTC and wants to offset any losses from their holdings.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This strategy requires an understanding of position sizing and timing but can still be relatively straightforward. Traders need to be more active in anticipating short-term and long-term price movements as well as managing several positions on the same asset.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Advanced: Dynamic Hedging and Arbitrage</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Taking that a step further, traders can use dynamic hedging to not only offset losses but to also take advantage of short-term price movements to create profit opportunities. Traders will need to actively adjust their hedges based on market conditions including funding rate changes, volatility spikes, and technical signals to limit downside and capture extra profit. This strategy requires more market awareness, good timing, and better familiarity with perp mechanics.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Advanced traders also use arbitrage strategies to profit from temporary price differences between the perpetual futures market and the spot market. This involves simultaneously buying the asset where it’s priced lower and selling it where it’s higher — often by buying on spot and shorting on perps when the futures market trades at a premium. The goal is to capture the spread as prices eventually align or as funding payments accrue. Since these opportunities can disappear within seconds, successful arbitrage requires large capital, rapid execution, and a deep understanding of market mechanics, funding rates, and exchange risks.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Advanced: Delta Neutral Strategy</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Delta-neutral strategies represent an advanced approach where traders open simultaneous long and short positions on the same asset to eliminate directional price exposure. While primarily used by market makers and sophisticated traders, these strategies have become popular among airdrop farmers seeking to generate trading volume and funding rate arbitrageurs capturing periodic payments from perpetual contracts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The core mechanics involve going long on spot while shorting an equivalent position in perpetuals (or vice versa), profiting from funding rate differentials rather than price movements. However, the October 10, 2025 market crash exposed a critical risk: <strong>auto-deleveraging (ADL)</strong>. When liquidations exceeded $5 billion and overwhelmed insurance funds, exchanges forcibly closed the most profitable positions to maintain solvency. Platforms like Hyperliquid triggered cross-margin ADL for the first time in over two years, while centralized exchanges saw billions in forced closures. This exposed a critical risk of delta neutral strategies that most traders had not considered, in which their short positions would be forcibly closed while their unprofitable longs remained open.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"risks-of-perpetual-trading\">Risks of Perpetual Trading</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Perp trading comes with a few layers of risk that can potentially magnify losses quickly.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Liquidation Risk</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Liquidation happens when the account balance falls below the maintenance margin. Depending on the trader’s position and capital, this can lead to quickly losing funds. Traders need to be aware of margin requirements and keep track of their positions to ensure it can stay above the maintenance margin.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Leverage</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A small price swing against a highly leveraged position can result in instant liquidation leaving the trader with no chance to exit. Since the crypto market can still face periods of substantial price movements, traders need to consider how much leverage they can afford to take.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Funding Rates/Slippage</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Holding a position for multiple funding intervals can cause funding rates to rack up. Continuous funding payments may also impact long-term profitability. Traders should account for these costs when holding positions for long periods.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"top-perp-dexs\">Top Perp DEXs</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, let's look at some of the most popular perp DEXs in the space.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Hyperliquid</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/hyperliquid\" target=\"_blank\">Hyperliquid</a> is a Layer 1 blockchain (L1) and DEX designed for fast perpetual futures and spot trading. It uses a custom system called HyperBFT to process trades quickly and keep fees low. Its native token, HYPE, is used for governance, staking, and rewards on the platform.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Designed to combine speed with decentralization, Hyperliquid lets users trade perps with advanced order types, low fees, and high throughput directly on-chain. It is positioned as one of the first DEXs capable of matching centralized exchanges in performance, though it still carries the usual risks of leveraged trading, smart-contract vulnerabilities, and evolving regulation. Hyperliquid’s <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/total-value-locked?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">total value locked (TVL)</a> is around <a href=\"http://defillama.com/protocol/hyperliquid\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$4.5 billion</a> at the time of writing with a daily perp volume of $10.7 billion.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Aster</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/aster-futures\" target=\"_blank\">Aster</a> is a next-generation decentralized perpetual exchange built from the merger of Astherus and APX Finance in late 2024, operating across BNB Chain, Ethereum, Solana, and Arbitrum. The platform is powered by Aster Chain, a Layer 1 blockchain that integrates zero-knowledge proofs to enable private yet auditable transactions, enhancing privacy and mitigating risks such as front-running and MEV attacks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Aster provides dual trading modes: Simple Mode for one-click trading with up to 1001x leverage and MEV protection, and Pro Mode with advanced order book features including hidden orders that remain invisible until execution. One of Aster's key innovations is its yield-optimized collateral system, allowing users to trade with productive assets like asBNB and yield-bearing USDF stablecoin while earning passive returns.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Since its launch, Aster has recorded <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/aster\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TVL</a> reaching over $2 billion with daily trading volumes repeatedly exceeding $10 billion. Backed by YZi Labs and closely associated with Binance co-founders, the platform has gained substantial traction in the BNB Chain ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Lighter</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/lighter\" target=\"_blank\">Lighter</a> is a decentralized perpetual-futures exchange built as a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/zero-knowledge-rollups?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">zk-rollup</a> on Ethereum, offering a central-limit order book trading experience with on-chain transparency. By using <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/zero-knowledge-proofs-and-zk-rollups?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">zero-knowledge proofs</a> for order matching and liquidations, it combines self-custody and verifiability with the speed and efficiency of centralized exchanges.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The platform has rapidly gained traction, reaching a <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/lighter\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TVL</a> of around $1.2 billion with daily trading volumes hovering near $10 billion at time of writing. While its rapid growth positions it as a serious competitor to Hyperliquid, analysts caution that trading activity may be partially driven by incentive programs and speculation of a token launch.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">EdgeX</h3>\n<p>Another up and coming platform is <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/edgex\" target=\"_blank\">edgeX</a>, a decentralized perpetual-futures exchange developed by Amber Group. It is built on StarkEx’s zero-knowledge rollup technology to offer high-speed, low-cost, and self-custodial trading on Ethereum. The platform claims it is able to process over 200,000 orders per second while offering the transparency and security of DeFi.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EdgeX provides advanced trading tools like trailing stop-loss orders, up to 100x leverage, and cross-chain support. It’s built on a modular DeFi infrastructure that allows for flexible product design, while using zero-knowledge proofs and Ethereum L1 settlement to ensure security and transparency.

Cross-Chain Protocol Explained\n</h1>\n<blockquote style=\"background-color: #e8fcc9; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem 1.75rem; margin: 2rem 0; font-style: normal;\">\n<h2 style=\"margin: 0px; font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.6; color: rgb(52, 175, 0); font-weight: 500;\" id=\"chainlink-ccip-overview\">Chainlink CCIP Overview</h2>\n\n\n</blockquote>\n<img src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34392/content_Chainlink_CCIP.webp\" alt=\"Chainlink CCIP\" />\n<p>The Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) is Chainlink's universal standard for secure cross-chain communication. It enables blockchains to send and receive both messages and value between any combination of public, private, and institutional blockchains. Since launching on mainnet in July 2023, CCIP has evolved from a roadmap item into a fully operational protocol that now connects over 60 blockchain networks and serves as critical infrastructure for both decentralized finance and institutional adoption.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-blockchain-interoperability-issue\">The Blockchain Interoperability Issue</h2>\n<p>The smart contract ecosystem has grown significantly in recent years, with numerous platforms emerging, each offering unique features and capabilities. However, this growth has created a fragmented landscape where assets and data remain isolated on individual chains. While this diversity drives innovation, it also creates significant challenges for users and developers who want to leverage the strengths of multiple networks.</p>\n<p>Traditional cross-chain bridges have attempted to solve this problem, but they come with serious limitations. Most notably, they represent single points of failure that have led to over <a href=\"https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cross-chain-bridge-hacks-2022/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$2 billion in exploits</a> in 2022 alone. Additionally, most bridges are limited to simple asset transfers and cannot handle complex data or smart contract instructions. This means they fall short of enabling true interoperability between blockchains.</p>\n<p>CCIP addresses these shortcomings by leveraging Chainlink's battle-tested Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs) to provide a level of security and reliability that existing bridges cannot match. The same infrastructure that has secured tens of billions of dollars in DeFi applications and enabled over $14 trillion in onchain transaction value now powers cross-chain communication.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-ccip-works-architecture-and-security-layers\">How CCIP Works: Architecture and Security Layers</h2>\n<p>CCIP's architecture sets it apart from traditional bridges through multiple layers of security and verification:</p>\n<h3>1. Messaging Router</h3>\n<p>The Messaging Router is the sole on-chain entry point on each supported blockchain for all outgoing CCIP messages. When a user or application initiates a cross-chain transaction, the Router logs the request and coordinates with the Chainlink Decentralized Oracle Networks to process and verify the transaction.</p>\n<h3>2. Chainlink Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs)</h3>\n<p>Two separate DONs work together to secure each cross-chain transaction:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Committing DON</strong>: This network observes events on the source chain, processes the cross-chain message, and commits a final signature to the destination chain's Router. This creates a verifiable record of the intended transaction.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Executing DON</strong>: This network independently observes the commitment from the Committing DON and executes the requested transaction on the destination chain. The separation of these two networks ensures no single point of failure exists.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3. Risk Management Network (RMN)</h3>\n<p>The Risk Management Network adds an additional independent security layer composed of separate Chainlink nodes. The RMN continuously monitors all CCIP transactions and has the authority to trigger an emergency halt on a chain-by-chain basis if it detects fraudulent or anomalous transfers. This prevents malicious activity before transactions are completed, providing a critical safety mechanism that traditional bridges lack.</p>\n<p>This multi-layered approach, combined with timelocked upgrades and rigorous node operator standards, creates a defense-in-depth security framework that significantly reduces the risks inherent in cross-chain operations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ccip-v1-5-major-features-and-capabilities\">CCIP v1.5: Major Features and Capabilities</h2>\n<p>Chainlink has continuously enhanced CCIP since its mainnet launch, with the v1.5 upgrade in January 2025 introducing features that expand the protocol's capabilities:</p>\n<h3>Cross-Chain Token (CCT) Standard</h3>\n<p>The CCT standard represents a major leap forward in how developers can make tokens cross-chain compatible. Unlike traditional bridges that require substantial liquidity pools and custom integrations, the CCT standard offers:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Self-Serve Deployment</strong>: Developers can now integrate existing or new tokens within minutes using the CCIP Token Manager, a no-code web interface, and the new CCIP SDK. This eliminates the need for complex bridge implementations and extensive technical resources.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Zero-Slippage Transfers</strong>: CCTs use secure burn/mint or lock/mint mechanisms instead of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-pools-crypto-defi\" target=\"_blank\">liquidity pools</a>, ensuring tokens can be transferred instantly without size limitations or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/slippage-crypto\" target=\"_blank\">slippage</a> (within configurable rate limits). This makes large transfers just as efficient as small ones.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Token Developer Attestation</strong>: An optional security feature where token developers can verify burn or lock events on the source chain before CCIP mints or unlocks tokens on the destination chain. This provides an extra layer of verification for compliance and security-conscious applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>CCIP Private Transactions</h3>\n<p>To meet the strict confidentiality and regulatory requirements of global financial institutions, Chainlink introduced privacy-preserving capabilities in late 2024:</p>\n<p>The Blockchain Privacy Manager enables CCIP Private Transactions, allowing institutions to transact across both public and private chains while keeping sensitive data —&nbsp; such as token amounts, counterparties, and transaction details — completely encrypted and confidential from node operators and other third parties.</p>\n<p>This feature has proven critical for the expansion of tokenized <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-real-world-assets-exploring-rwa-protocols\" target=\"_blank\">real-world assets (RWAs)</a>, enabling banks and financial institutions to move tokenized assets across jurisdictions while maintaining client confidentiality and adhering to compliance policies. Major institutions including ANZ Bank and Fidelity International have utilized these capabilities in their blockchain initiatives.</p>\n<h2 id=\"real-world-use-cases-and-adoption\">Real-World Use Cases and Adoption</h2>\n<p>CCIP's secure architecture and advanced features have positioned it as essential infrastructure connecting traditional finance with decentralized systems. The protocol now serves multiple critical use cases:</p>\n<h3>Financial Services and Institutional Adoption</h3>\n<p>CCIP facilitates sophisticated cross-border transactions and atomic settlements for major financial institutions. Global organizations including Swift, UBS Asset Management, and J.P. Morgan are conducting pilots for cross-chain settlement and Delivery vs. Payment (DvP) workflows using CCIP.</p>\n<p>The protocol's ability to handle both public and private blockchain networks makes it particularly valuable for institutions that need to maintain confidentiality while leveraging blockchain technology. This has made CCIP a key enabler for the tokenization of traditional financial assets.</p>\n<h3>Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs)</h3>\n<p>CCIP has become the infrastructure of choice for orchestrating the movement of tokenized funds, bonds, and other real-world assets. It enables compliant, cross-border, and cross-chain transactions that meet regulatory requirements while maintaining the efficiency benefits of blockchain technology.</p>\n<p>Financial institutions like ANZ Bank and Fidelity International are using CCIP to power their tokenization initiatives, demonstrating the protocol's readiness for institutional-grade applications.</p>\n<h3>DeFi Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Leading DeFi protocols have integrated CCIP to enable secure cross-chain functionality:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Aave</strong>: The decentralized lending protocol uses CCIP to enable its decentralized stablecoin <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/gho\" target=\"_blank\">GHO</a> to operate seamlessly across multiple chains.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Synthetix</strong>: The derivatives platform leverages CCIP for cross-chain asset movements.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Solv Protocol</strong>: Uses CCIP to secure cross-chain transfers of its wrapped Bitcoin product (<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solv-protocol-btc\" target=\"_blank\">SolvBTC</a>).</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Lido</strong>: Implements CCIP's Programmable Token Transfers for Direct Staking, simplifying staking across <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/layer-2-l2\" target=\"_blank\">Layer 2 networks</a> and improving liquidity for wstETH.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These integrations demonstrate how CCIP enables DeFi applications to scale beyond single-chain limitations while maintaining security and decentralization.</p>\n<h3>Universal Connectivity</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">CCIP now connects over 60 public and private blockchains through a single integration point, all running on the Chainlink Runtime Environment (CRE). This includes major networks such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/avalanche-network\" target=\"_blank\">Avalanche</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/polygon-pos\" target=\"_blank\">Polygon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/arbitrum-one\" target=\"_blank\">Arbitrum</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/optimistic-ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">Optimism</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/base\" target=\"_blank\">Base</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/binance-smart-chain\" target=\"_blank\">BNB Chain</a>, and many others, with additional chains being added regularly.</p>\n<p>This universal connectivity means developers can build applications that tap into the unique advantages of multiple blockchains — whether that's Ethereum's security, Layer 2 networks' lower costs, or specialized chains' unique features — without building separate integrations for each network.</p>\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-ccip\">Benefits of CCIP</h2>\n<p>CCIP offers several key advantages over traditional cross-chain solutions:</p>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Security</strong>: Multiple layers of security including dual DON architecture, the Risk Management Network, and Chainlink's proven <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-blockchain-oracle?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">oracle</a> infrastructure significantly reduce the risk of exploits and failures.</p>\n<p><strong>True Interoperability</strong>: Unlike basic bridges that only transfer assets, CCIP enables complex cross-chain applications by supporting both arbitrary data messaging and token transfers in a single transaction (programmable token transfers).</p>\n<p><strong>Developer Efficiency</strong>: A single integration connects applications to over 60 blockchain networks, dramatically reducing development time and complexity compared to building individual bridge implementations.</p>\n<p><strong>Zero-Slippage Token Transfers</strong>: The CCT standard eliminates the need for large liquidity pools, enabling instant transfers of any size without slippage concerns.</p>\n<p><strong>Privacy Options</strong>: CCIP Private Transactions meet institutional requirements for confidentiality, making the protocol suitable for regulated financial applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Proven Track Record</strong>: Built on the same infrastructure that has secured tens of billions of dollars in DeFi and enabled trillions in transaction value.</p>\n<h2 id=\"challenges-and-considerations\">Challenges and Considerations</h2>\n<p>While CCIP offers significant advantages, users and developers should be aware of certain considerations:</p>\n<p><strong>Technical Complexity</strong>: Implementing cross-chain solutions requires careful attention to security and proper integration. While CCIP simplifies this compared to building custom bridges, developers still need to understand cross-chain mechanics and potential edge cases.</p>\n<p><strong>Rate Limits and Configuration</strong>: To maintain security, CCIP implements rate limits on token transfers. While these can be configured, they require proper planning for high-volume applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Gas Costs</strong>: Cross-chain transactions inherently involve <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/gas-fees?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">gas&nbsp;fees</a> on multiple networks. While CCIP optimizes these costs, users should understand that cross-chain operations are typically more expensive than single-chain transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Network Dependencies</strong>: Cross-chain transactions depend on the availability and performance of both source and destination chains. Congestion or issues on either chain can affect transaction timing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-future-of-blockchain-interoperability\">The Future of Blockchain Interoperability</h2>\n<p>CCIP represents a fundamental shift in how blockchains can work together. Just as standards like TCP/IP unified the fragmented early internet into a single global network, CCIP aims to connect the multi-chain blockchain landscape into what Chainlink calls the \"Internet of Contracts.\"</p>\n<p>The protocol continues to evolve, with ongoing integrations of new blockchains and features. Chainlink's meetings with over 100 major financial institutions across regions including Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Sydney demonstrate the growing institutional interest in using CCIP for tokenized assets and cross-border transactions.</p>\n<p>As the blockchain ecosystem matures, the ability to seamlessly move assets and data across chains will become increasingly critical.

In 2024, the platform migrated to its own Layer 1 blockchain and launched its native <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/hyperliquid\" target=\"_blank\">HYPE</a> token via an <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-hyperliquid-and-what-the-hyperliquid-airdrop-means-for-defi\" target=\"_blank\">airdrop</a> that was widely praised as one of the most successful token launches in DeFi.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The platform has since gained attention for offering deep liquidity, low fees, and a user experience comparable to centralized exchanges — while maintaining the self-custody advantages of DeFi. Since launching its mainnet, Hyperliquid has processed billions in trading volume and is now the largest perp DEX by <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/derivatives/decentralized\" target=\"_blank\">open interest</a>, with the highest <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/token-buybacks\" target=\"_blank\">token buyback</a> volume recorded in 2025.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"top-5-methods-to-bridge-to-hyperliquid\">Top 5 Methods to Bridge to Hyperliquid</h2>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">1. Jumper Exchange</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Jumper Exchange is a cross-chain bridge aggregator that supports bridging to Hyperliquid among hundreds of other chains. Jumper specializes in finding the most efficient routes across the multi-chain ecosystem by aggregating multiple bridge providers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How it works: Jumper aggregates liquidity from multiple bridge providers and DEXs (decentralized exchanges) to create optimal bridging routes. In the examples below, you will see that fees and transaction routes differ from platform to platform. An aggregator skips the manual process of finding the best route and simplifies the process for users.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Best for: Users who prioritize finding the absolute best rate and want a simplified and easy-to-understand UI.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bridge time: A wide range of 1 to 20 minutes as Jumper allows the user to select and customize their preferred route, speed and asset pair.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fees: The same rates as if you used these separate bridges manually as Jumper does not charge any additional fees for this service as of writing.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bridging Guide</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Step 1: Go to <a href=\"https://jumper.exchange/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://jumper.exchange/</a>, select your source chain, deposit asset and destination chain (Hyperliquid or HyperEVM). Select your preferred route and confirm the transactions as prompted.</p>\n<img src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34380/content_jumper_example_hl.webp\" alt=\"Jumper example\" />\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">2. LayerZero</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Several bridges built on LayerZero (an interoperability protocol that allows different blockchains to communicate) support Hyperliquid as a destination. These include bridges like Stargate Finance and other LayerZero-powered applications.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How it works: <meta charset=\"utf-8\">LayerZero connects over 150 blockchains through a secure messaging protocol that allows any application to send tokens, data, or instructions between networks. At the core of this system is the Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) Standard, which enables tokens to exist natively across chains while maintaining a single, unified supply. When an OFT moves between blockchains, it burns on the source chain and mints on the destination — ensuring 1:1 parity, eliminating wrapped assets, and enabling transfers at the cost of gas with zero slippage. LayerZero’s modular architecture uses Decentralized Verifier Networks (DVNs)—independent entities that verify cross-chain messages—and is now adopted by over 600 applications and 525 assets.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Best for: <meta charset=\"utf-8\">Users looking to move tokens with maximum efficiency. OFTs are the most cost-effective way to transfer assets — moving 1:1 across chains with zero slippage and only a small gas fee. For active DeFi users, this means larger transfers without losing value to bridge spreads or hidden costs. Stargate also supports direct deposits into Hyperliquid Spot for select assets, giving traders a seamless way to bridge and trade in a single step — ideal for users who regularly optimize their cross-chain routes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bridge time: A wide range, anywhere from 10 seconds to 20 minutes, depending on the selected route.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fees: Varies depending on the asset. Any OFT moves for the cost of gas, with zero slippage. Other non-OFT assets via Stargate are competitive.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bridging Guide</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Step 1: Go to <a href=\"https://stargate.finance/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://stargate.finance/</a>, select your source chain, deposit asset and destination chain (Hyperliquid or HyperEVM). If the option is grayed out, then it is an unsupported asset, try another combination.</p>\n<img src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34381/content_stargate_destination_chain_search.webp\" alt=\"stargate destination chain search\" />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Step 2: Review your selected bridging route and confirm the transaction. Note that bridge transactions using Circle’s CCTP will require a separate token claim.</p>\n<img src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34382/content_stargate_bridge_simulation_.webp\" alt=\"stargate bridge simulation\" />\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">3. Hyperliquid Native Bridge (from Arbitrum)</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Hyperliquid native bridge is the official and original bridge into the Hyperliquid ecosystem. The bridge was built during the early days where Hyperliquid operated functionally as a Layer 3 within the Arbitrum Layer 2 ecosystem before its L1 mainnet launch in 2024. After migrating to its own Layer 1, Hyperliquid maintains the Arbitrum bridge as the official and default bridge into the ecosystem.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How it works: You connect your wallet to the Hyperliquid interface, select the amount of USDC you want to bridge from Arbitrum, and the bridge transfers your assets directly to your Hyperliquid address. The native bridge benefits from direct integration with Hyperliquid's infrastructure and is secured by the validator network. Deposits are typically processed within 1 to 3 minutes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Best for: Users who already have USDC on Arbitrum or those who prefer using official, first-party infrastructure. This is generally the most straightforward option if you're coming from the Arbitrum ecosystem.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bridge time: Typically 1-3 minutes</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fees: Minimal Arbitrum gas fees (usually less than $1). Bridging fees for deposits are fully subsidized by Hyperliquid but withdrawals have a 1 USDC fee to cover validator gas costs.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bridging Guide</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Step 1: Go to <a href=\"https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/trade\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/trade</a>, connect your wallet and click “Deposit”</p>\n<img src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34383/content_hypercore_deposit_button.webp\" alt=\"hypercore deposit button\" />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Step 2: Select and confirm your deposit asset (USDC is most common)</p>\n<img src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34384/content_hypercore_native_bridge_simulation.webp\" alt=\"hypercore bridge simulation\" />\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">4. Hyperunit</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hyperunit is a native asset bridging layer that allows users to deposit native assets such as BTC, SOL, ETH and more directly onto Hyperliquid without converting into a stablecoin like USDC.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How it works: Hyperunit uses a lock-and-mint bridging system with a decentralized Guardian network. When you deposit native BTC, ETH, or SOL, Hyperunit locks your assets with Guardian custodians on the origin blockchain and mints tokenized versions (uBTC, uETH, uSOL) that you can use on Hyperliquid. These tokenized assets can be traded on Hyperliquid's spot order books, used as collateral for trading, or deployed in DeFi applications on HyperEVM . When you want to exit, you burn the tokenized assets and Hyperunit releases your original native assets back to your wallet.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Best for: Users who want to bridge native BTC, ETH, or SOL into Hyperliquid without converting into USDC. Hyperunit also serves as an alternative to non-Arbitrum users as they accept funds from the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana networks and other networks respectively.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bridge time: Typically 2-10 minutes depending on the origin blockchain's confirmation requirements.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fees: Network dependent but typically ~$1.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bridging Guide&nbsp;</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Step 1: Go to <a href=\"https://app.hyperunit.xyz/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://app.hyperunit.xyz/</a>, select your deposit network, asset, and send at least the minimum amount to the displayed address.</p>\n<img src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34385/content_hyperunit_deposit_simulation.webp\" alt=\"hyperunit deposit simulation\" />\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">5. Across Protocol</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Across Protocol is an intent-based bridge that has facilitated over $27.5 billion in volume across 17.3 million transfers for more than 4 million users. Across supports bridging USDC and USDT to both Hyperliquid (HyperCore) and HyperEVM from over 20 blockchains including Ethereum, Solana, Base, Arbitrum, and Polygon.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How it works: Across uses an intents-based system where relayers compete to fulfill your bridge request, resulting in extremely fast transfers — as quick as 2 seconds for Layer 2 to Hyperliquid routes. Across was the first bridge to support gasless permit signatures for Hyperliquid deposits, making the process smoother and more cost-effective.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Best for: Users who prioritize speed above all else, especially those bridging from Layer 2 networks. Across is ideal for active traders who need to move funds quickly to capitalize on market opportunities.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bridge time: As fast as 2 seconds for L2 routes, typically under 1 minute for most routes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fees: Most transfers under $1, a fee of $0.04 is shown in our simulations.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bridging Guide</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Step 1: Go to <a href=\"https://app.across.to/bridge\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://app.across.to/bridge</a>, select your source chain and deposit asset and destination chain (Hyperliquid or HyperEVM), and confirm your transaction. Unlike our previous example, Across supports USDC deposits directly onto Hyperliquid.</p>\n<img src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34386/content_across_bridge_simulation.webp\" alt=\"across bridge simulation\" />\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"understanding-hypercore-and-hyperevm-where-to-bridge-your-assets\">Understanding HyperCore and HyperEVM: Where to Bridge Your Assets</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mentioned above, there are 2 destination options you can choose if you wish to bridge to Hyperliquid, “Hyperliquid” or HyperEVM. This is because Hyperliquid’s L1 is uniquely separated into 2 parts, HyperCore and HyperEVM. The “Hyperliquid” option refers to HyperCore.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Is HyperCore and HyperEVM?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">HyperCore is Hyperliquid’s main segment where the perpetual futures and spot trading happens. It is a specially optimized Layer 1 equipped with the high-performance trading engine that most users interact with when they think of Hyperliquid. HyperCore uses the HyperBFT consensus mechanism to achieve sub-second latency and offers gasless trading (you only pay trading fees, not network gas fees). Basically, HyperCore refers to anything on the <a href=\"https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/trade\">https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/trade</a> front end.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">HyperEVM is Hyperliquid's Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible layer that runs alongside HyperCore. It allows developers to deploy <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-smart-contracts\">smart contracts</a> (self-executing programs on the blockchain) and build decentralized applications like lending protocols, staking platforms, and other DeFi services on Hyperliquid. To summarize, HyperEVM is where independent Hyperliquid native DeFi applications such as Kinetiq, HyperLend, HypurrFi and others, operate on.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How to Transfer Between HyperCore and HyperEVM</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the most useful features of Hyperliquid is that you can easily move assets between HyperCore and HyperEVM without using an external bridge. This internal transfer mechanism is called \"native transfer\" and works through a simple process.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To transfer from HyperCore to HyperEVM:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Go to the Hyperliquid app at <a href=\"https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/trade\">https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/trade</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<div dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Navigate to your portfolio balance and select the “Transfer to/from EVM” option.&nbsp;<img alt=\"hypercore internal transfers\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34387/content_hypercore_internal_transfer_button.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 751px;\">\n</div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<div dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Click the \"Send\" or \"Transfer to EVM\" button.&nbsp;<img alt=\"hypercore internal transfer\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34388/content_hypercore_evm_transfer.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 798px;\">\n</div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Specify the amount you wish to transfer and confirm the transaction.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Your tokens will appear in your HyperEVM wallet within seconds to a minute. You'll receive the tokens at the same wallet address you sent from. Important note: You may need to manually add the token contract address to your wallet (like MetaMask) for the tokens to display properly on HyperEVM.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">When Should You Use HyperCore vs. HyperEVM?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bridge to HyperCore when you want to:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Trade perpetual futures or spot markets on Hyperliquid's exchange.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Take advantage of gasless trading with sub-second execution.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Access deep liquidity for trading popular cryptocurrency pairs.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Deposit funds into trading vaults like the HLP (Hyperliquid Liquidity Provider) vault.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Execute advanced order types like TWAP (time-weighted average price) or scale orders.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bridge to HyperEVM when you want to:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Use any of the DeFi applications built on Hyperliquid, such as lending protocols or decentralized applications.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Stake tokens with validators through DeFi protocols (separate from the exchange's native staking).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Use HYPE in more complex DeFi operations.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most users should start with HyperCore if their primary goal is trading. All the major bridges (native Hyperliquid bridge, LayerZero bridges, Across, Hyperunit, and Jumper) will send assets to HyperCore by default. You can always transfer assets to HyperEVM later using the native transfer mechanism if you want to explore DeFi applications.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, if you're specifically interested in HyperEVM's DeFi ecosystem from the start, bridges like Across or LayerZero explicitly support direct deposits to HyperEVM, saving you the extra step of doing a native transfer.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"bridge-comparison-table\">Bridge Comparison Table</h2>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"which-bridge-should-you-use\">Which Bridge Should You Use?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Choosing the right bridge depends on your specific situation:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you prioritize finding the absolute lowest fees: Use Jumper Exchange and compare multiple route options. Jumper's aggregation surfaces the most cost-effective paths across different bridges without charging additional aggregator fees. Jumper is also excellent if you're bridging from more exotic or lesser-known chains.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you're starting with funds on Arbitrum: Use the Hyperliquid native bridge. It's the most direct route, secured by Hyperliquid's validators, and usually has the lowest fees since you're avoiding additional cross-chain hops.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If speed is your top priority: Choose Across Protocol. With transfers as fast as 2 seconds from Layer 2 networks and sub-$1 fees, Across is purpose-built for traders who need to move funds quickly. It's especially ideal if you're bridging from Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, or other L2s.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you want to bridge native BTC, ETH, or SOL: Use Hyperunit. Unlike other bridges that require converting to USDC first, Hyperunit allows you to deposit native assets directly and receive tokenized versions (uBTC, uETH, uSOL) that can be used for trading or as collateral on Hyperliquid.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you're already using LayerZero ecosystem products: Consider LayerZero-compatible bridges like Stargate Finance. These bridges leverage LayerZero's omnichain infrastructure and are ideal if you regularly use LayerZero applications or are bridging unsupported assets directly to HyperEVM.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you need to bridge to HyperEVM specifically: Across and LayerZero bridges explicitly support direct bridging to HyperEVM, saving you the step of doing a native transfer from HyperCore. This is ideal if you want to interact with DeFi applications, stake through protocols, or use smart contracts on HyperEVM right away.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you're bridging large amounts: The Hyperliquid native bridge is preferred as it is the most robust bridge with little to no slippage.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">General recommendations by source chain:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">From Arbitrum: <strong>Native Hyperliquid bridge</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Across&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Jumper</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">From Ethereum: <strong>Across</strong>, <strong>Jumper,</strong> or <strong>LayerZero</strong> bridges (or <strong>Hyperunit </strong>for native ETH)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">From Base: <strong>Across </strong>(fastest) or <strong>Jumper</strong></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">From Polygon: <strong>Across</strong>, <strong>Jumper</strong>, or <strong>LayerZero</strong> bridges</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">From Solana: <strong>Across</strong>, <strong>Jumper,</strong> or <strong>Hyperunit</strong> (for native SOL)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">From Bitcoin: Hyperunit (only option for native BTC)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">From other chains: <strong>Jumper</strong> or <strong>LayerZero</strong> bridges for broadest coverage</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Note: The above recommendations are generally accurate at the time of writing, but may change in time.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bridging to Hyperliquid has become increasingly accessible with multiple options catering to different needs and starting points. Whether you choose the native Arbitrum bridge for directness, LayerZero-compatible bridges for ecosystem integration, Across for maximum speed, Hyperunit for a Hyperliquid-focused interface, or Jumper for best rates, each method offers a viable path to accessing Hyperliquid's decentralized perpetual trading platform and growing DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Understanding the distinction between HyperCore and HyperEVM is also crucial for optimizing your Hyperliquid experience. Most traders will start with HyperCore for its gasless perpetual trading, but the ability to easily transfer assets to HyperEVM opens up additional opportunities in DeFi applications, staking, and smart contract interactions. The native transfer mechanism makes moving between these layers seamless and nearly instantaneous.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Remember to always verify you're using official bridge interfaces, double-check recipient addresses, and consider starting with small test amounts before moving significant funds. The decentralized nature of these bridges means transactions are irreversible, so careful attention to detail is essential. Also pay attention to whether you're bridging to HyperCore (for trading) or HyperEVM (for DeFi applications) to ensure your assets arrive at the right destination for your intended use case.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>This article is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice. Bridging cryptocurrency assets involves technical and financial risks, including but not limited to potential loss of funds due to smart contract vulnerabilities, bridge exploits, user error, or other unforeseen issues. Always conduct your own research, verify all bridge URLs and addresses, understand the risks involved before executing any transactions.</em></p>\n<h3 class=\"tw-text-lg md:tw-text-2xl tw-font-bold tw-text-gray-900 dark:tw-text-white dark:tw-text-opacity-87\">\n  Related Articles\n</h3>"

Imagine proving you're old enough to vote without showing your birth date, or demonstrating you have enough money for a purchase without revealing your bank balance. This seemingly magical property has applications far beyond simple privacy — it's becoming the foundation for scaling the world's blockchains.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the blockchain world, zero-knowledge technology has evolved from an academic curiosity into a cornerstone of Ethereum's scaling roadmap. What began as a theoretical solution to blockchain's capacity limitations has matured into production-ready infrastructure processing millions of daily transactions. By November 2025, ZK-rollups — <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/layer-2-l2?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Layer 2 networks</a> powered by zero-knowledge proofs — have become essential to Ethereum's vision of scaling to billions of users without sacrificing decentralization or security.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"what-are-zero-knowledge-proofs\">What Are Zero-Knowledge Proofs?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let's start with an analogy that makes zero-knowledge proofs easy to understand.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Imagine a cave with two entrances that connect in the middle through a locked door. You know the secret password to open the door. Your friend wants proof that you know the password, but you don't want to tell them what it is.</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You enter the cave while your friend waits outside</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You randomly choose to go through either the left or right entrance</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Your friend then shouts which entrance they want you to exit from</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Because you know the password, you can unlock the door if needed and exit from the correct side</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">After repeating this process many times, your friend becomes convinced you know the password — without ever learning what it is</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is the essence of a zero-knowledge proof: proving you possess knowledge without revealing the knowledge itself.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In blockchain applications, zero-knowledge proofs work similarly. A \"prover\" (like a rollup network) can prove to a \"verifier\" (like Ethereum) that thousands of transactions were executed correctly — without the verifier needing to check each transaction individually. The verifier only needs to check a small cryptographic proof, saving massive amounts of time and computational resources.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"two-faces-of-zero-knowledge-scaling-vs-privacy\">Two Faces of Zero-Knowledge: Scaling vs. Privacy</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are two distinct applications of ZK technology:</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">1. ZK for Scaling (Transparent Ledgers)</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Projects like zkSync Era, Scroll, Linea, and Starknet use ZK proofs to compress thousands of transactions into one validity proof, saving space and gas costs. These networks use zero-knowledge technology purely for efficiency: bundling many transactions together and proving they're all valid with a single compact proof.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the ledger remains fully public — every transaction is visible on block explorers, just like on Ethereum. This makes them ideal for decentralized finance, NFT marketplaces, and any application requiring public verifiability while benefiting from lower costs and faster processing.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Using a ZK-rollup like zkSync or Scroll does NOT make your transactions private. They're as transparent as Ethereum — just faster and cheaper.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">2. ZK for Privacy (Encrypted Transactions)</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Privacy coins like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/monero\" target=\"_blank\">Monero (XMR)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zcash\" target=\"_blank\">Zcash (ZEC)</a> use zero-knowledge proofs in a fundamentally different way — to hide transaction details while still proving their validity. Monero uses ring signatures combined with stealth addresses to obscure transaction origins and destinations, while Zcash employs zk-SNARKs to enable completely shielded transactions where amounts, senders, and recipients can all be hidden. In the case of Zcash, users have the flexibility to choose between transparent and shielded transaction options.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/3-most-popular-privacy-coins-and-the-tech-behind-them?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">technologies</a> enable true financial privacy where transactions can be verified as legitimate without revealing sensitive information about who is transacting or for how much.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"what-are-zk-rollups\">What Are ZK-Rollups?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/zero-knowledge-rollups?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">ZK-rollups</a> are a Layer 2 scaling solution that bundles hundreds or thousands of transactions together, processes them off-chain, and then submits a single cryptographic proof to the Ethereum mainnet. This dramatically reduces the amount of data that needs to be processed on the main chain.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How ZK-Rollups Work</h3>\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Transaction Batching</strong>: Multiple transactions are collected and grouped together off-chain.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Off-Chain Execution</strong>: These transactions are executed on the Layer 2 network.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Proof Generation</strong>: A zero-knowledge proof is created that cryptographically verifies all transactions in the batch are valid.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>On-Chain Verification</strong>: Only the proof and minimal transaction data are submitted to Ethereum.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>State Update</strong>: Ethereum verifies the proof and updates its state accordingly.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The entire process takes minutes rather than days, and it's far more efficient than processing each transaction individually on Layer 1.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"types-of-zero-knowledge-proofs\">Types of Zero-Knowledge Proofs</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are two different types of zero-knowledge proofs:</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge)</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">zk-SNARKs produce very small proofs that are fast to verify, making them ideal for blockchain applications where minimizing on-chain data is crucial. However, they require a \"trusted setup\" ceremony where initial parameters are generated, and if these parameters are compromised, the security of the entire system could be at risk. Despite this trade-off, zk-SNARKs remain popular due to their efficiency. They're used by <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/zksync\" target=\"_blank\">zkSync</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/polygon-pos\" target=\"_blank\">Polygon</a> zkEVM, and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/linea\" target=\"_blank\">Linea</a>.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">zk-STARKs (Zero-Knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge)</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">zk-STARKs eliminate the need for a trusted setup, making them more transparent and theoretically more secure. They're also quantum-resistant, meaning they should remain secure even as quantum computers become more powerful. The trade-off is that zk-STARK proofs are larger than zk-SNARK proofs, making them slightly more expensive to verify on-chain. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/starknet\" target=\"_blank\">Starknet</a> is the primary project using zk-STARKs.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"the-eip-4844-revolution\">The EIP-4844 Revolution</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ethereum's EIP-4844 (Proto-Danksharding), implemented in early 2024, transformed the rollup landscape by introducing \"blob\" transactions. This innovation slashed <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/data-availability-blockchain-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">data availability</a> costs — historically the biggest expense for rollups — by 30-50% or more.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Changed</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/eip-4844-proto-danksharding-low-gas-fees?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">EIP-4844</a>, rollups paid expensive calldata costs to post transaction data on Ethereum's permanent storage. After the upgrade, rollups use cheaper \"blob space\" — temporary data storage that's automatically pruned after approximately 18 days but remains available long enough for security purposes. This cost reduction made ZK-rollups economically competitive with optimistic rollups and accelerated adoption throughout 2024-2025.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"zk-rollups-vs-optimistic-rollups\">ZK-Rollups vs. Optimistic Rollups</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Both are Layer 2 scaling solutions, but they use different approaches to verify transactions:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While Optimistic rollups still lead in Total Value Secured, ZK-rollups have closed the compatibility gap entirely. Projects like zkSync Era, Polygon zkEVM, Scroll, and Linea have been on mainnet for extended periods by 2025, allowing developers to deploy Solidity code directly without learning new programming languages. The main practical difference users experience is withdrawal time — ZK-rollups enable much faster bridging back to Ethereum.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"top-zk-rollup-projects-in-2025\">Top ZK-Rollup Projects in 2025</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are some of the top zk-rollup projects to watch:</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Linea</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Developed by ConsenSys — the team behind MetaMask — <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/linea\" target=\"_blank\">Linea</a> has seen massive adoption due to seamless wallet integration that enables one-click onboarding through the world's most popular Ethereum wallet. The network is available directly through MetaMask, removing friction for users already familiar with the wallet interface.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Linea represents the \"institutional-grade\" ZK-EVM with its focus on security audits, regulatory compliance considerations, and integration with established DeFi protocols. The network is fully EVM-equivalent, allowing developers to use the same code as Ethereum on Linea.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Mantle Network (MNT)</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/mantle\" target=\"_blank\">Mantle</a> completed a significant upgrade in 2025 to become the first <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/optimism-superchain-interoperability-ethereum?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">OP Stack</a> L2 to launch as a ZK Validity Rollup, combining the efficiency of optimistic rollups with the cryptographic security of ZK proofs. With over $2 billion in total value secured according to DeFiLlama, Mantle is now one of the largest ZK rollups.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The hybrid architecture separates validators and relayers into distinct components, reducing systemic risk — if one part is compromised, the rest of the system remains secure. ZK proofs add cryptographic finality while the Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS) staking distributes control across a broader set of participants.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Starknet (STRK)</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/starknet\" target=\"_blank\">Starknet</a> remains a throughput leader, powered by its custom Cairo programming language and STARK proofs that are quantum-resistant and require no trusted setup. In mid-2025, StarkNet reached Stage 1 decentralization — a milestone in Vitalik Buterin's framework for rollup networks that indicates the network has passed key technical and governance thresholds bringing it closer to full decentralization.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The average transaction fee on StarkNet is around $0.02, with the network recording over 127 TPS in late 2024 and sub-2-second confirmation times. The STRK token is used for governance and staking within the ecosystem.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Scroll (SCR)</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/scroll\" target=\"_blank\">Scroll</a> offers \"bytecode compatibility\" with the Ethereum Virtual Machine — meaning it's virtually identical to Ethereum for developers. Any code that runs on Ethereum runs on Scroll without requiring any modifications.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">ZKsync Era (ZK)</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zksync\" target=\"_blank\">ZKsync</a> has evolved into the \"Elastic Chain\" — a network of interoperable Hyperchains that share liquidity and security while allowing each chain to customize its parameters. The network has processed around 465 million transactions since launch with an average block time of 2 to 4 seconds, and average fees of around $0.03 per transaction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ZKsync offers native <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/account-abstraction-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">account abstraction</a> at the protocol level, making crypto wallets significantly easier for mainstream users by enabling features like social recovery, session keys, and gasless transactions.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Polygon (POL) &amp; The AggLayer</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Polygon has evolved beyond its sidechain origins, rebranding its token to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polygon\" target=\"_blank\">POL</a> and launching the Aggregation Layer (AggLayer) — technology that unifies liquidity across multiple ZK chains, making them feel like a single chain from the user's perspective.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Polygon zkEVM is fully EVM-equivalent and maintains opcode compatibility with the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/evm?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum Virtual Machine</a>, enabling developers to bring their smart contracts to the network with minimal support required.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"zk-beyond-ethereum\">ZK Beyond Ethereum</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While Ethereum was the testing ground, ZK technology has now expanded across the entire crypto ecosystem.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin's ZK Layer: Citrea &amp; BitVM</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For over a decade, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/ordinals\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin</a> was considered too simple for smart contracts due to its deliberately limited scripting language. In 2025, projects like Citrea are changing this paradigm using BitVM — a novel construction that enables complex computations to be verified on Bitcoin without changing its core protocol.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Citrea operates as a ZK-rollup for Bitcoin that verifies proofs natively on the Bitcoin network, allowing users to deploy their <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\">BTC</a> in DeFi applications with Bitcoin's unparalleled security guarantees. This breakthrough unlocks dormant capital that was previously locked in Bitcoin's non-programmable environment, bringing programmability to the largest and most secure blockchain without compromising its conservative design philosophy.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Solana's ZK Compression</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/solana\" target=\"_blank\">Solana</a> uses ZK technology in a completely different way from Ethereum — not for transaction rollups, but for state compression. Through innovations like Light Protocol and Helius, Solana developers now use ZK Compression to dramatically reduce on-chain storage costs. Instead of storing expensive data like token balances directly on-chain where storage is costly, developers store only a tiny ZK \"fingerprint\" on-chain while keeping the actual data in cheaper off-chain storage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This approach has reduced the cost of operations like airdropping tokens to millions of users by nearly 1,000x, making Solana the most cost-effective chain for massive-scale consumer applications in 2025.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Privacy Coins: Monero and Zcash</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The privacy coin landscape showcases two different approaches to using zero-knowledge technology for transaction privacy.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Monero (XMR) uses ring signatures, stealth addresses, and RingCT (Ring Confidential Transactions) to provide mandatory privacy for all transactions — amounts, senders, and receivers are automatically obscured. Every transaction mixes with others to hide its origin, making Monero the most private cryptocurrency by default.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Zcash (ZEC), on the other hand, employs zk-SNARKs to enable shielded transactions but gives users a choice — transactions can be fully transparent, fully shielded, or a mix of both. Shielded transactions completely hide all transaction metadata while still being cryptographically verifiable as valid.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Programmable Privacy L1s</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">New Layer 1 blockchains are embedding ZK technology directly into their architecture to enable private applications, not just private payments.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aleo\" target=\"_blank\">Aleo</a> takes a radical approach where users execute transactions locally on their own device, generating ZK proofs of correct execution, and only send these proofs to the network. This keeps user data and application logic entirely off-chain while still enabling public verification that rules were followed. The result is a platform where users can run private applications — from private DeFi strategies to confidential voting systems — without revealing sensitive information to the network.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Midnight, a partner chain for Cardano, focuses on selective disclosure and regulatory compliance. The platform allows businesses and individuals to prove specific statements about themselves — such as \"I am over 18 years old\" or \"I have sufficient funds for this transaction\" — without revealing underlying personal information like exact age or bank balance. This selective disclosure model makes Midnight particularly attractive for enterprise applications that must balance privacy requirements with regulatory compliance.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"challenges-facing-zero-knowledge-projects\">Challenges Facing Zero-Knowledge Projects</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite significant progress, ZK technology still faces several obstacles that projects are actively working to overcome.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Prover Centralization</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While ZK-rollup networks themselves are decentralized with distributed validators and open participation, the specialized servers that generate zero-knowledge proofs (called \"provers\") are often run by the founding teams or a small set of entities. Generating ZK proofs requires significant computational resources — often necessitating powerful GPUs or custom ASICs — which creates barriers to entry for independent operators. If a single entity controls proof generation, it could theoretically censor transactions by refusing to include them in proofs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Projects are addressing this through hardware acceleration to lower costs, decentralized prover networks with economic incentives, and ongoing research into more efficient proof systems that reduce computational requirements.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Liquidity Fragmentation</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The ZK ecosystem now includes multiple competing chains — Scroll, zkSync, Linea, Polygon zkEVM, Starknet, and more — each with its own isolated liquidity pool. A user with assets on zkSync cannot easily interact with applications on Scroll without bridging funds, creating friction and splitting capital across ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This fragmentation means DeFi protocols must choose which chains to deploy on, developers must build cross-chain infrastructure, and users face a confusing landscape of disconnected networks. Solutions emerging include Polygon's AggLayer technology that creates a unified liquidity layer across ZK chains, zkSync's Elastic Chain architecture for seamless interoperability between Hyperchains, and cross-chain messaging protocols that enable atomic swaps and unified state across rollups.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Proving Time and Costs</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Generating zero-knowledge proofs remains computationally intensive and can take minutes to hours depending on the complexity of the computation being proven. This creates latency in transaction finality and increases operational costs for rollup operators. While proof verification on Ethereum is quick, the generation process requires substantial resources.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The industry is addressing this challenge through better software that generates proofs faster, specialized computer chips designed for ZK calculations, and techniques that combine multiple proofs into one to improve efficiency. As these technologies mature, proof generation is becoming faster and cheaper.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Developer Education and Tooling</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Understanding zero-knowledge cryptography requires specialized knowledge, creating a steep learning curve. Additionally, debugging ZK circuits when things go wrong is significantly more challenging than traditional smart contract development. The ecosystem is addressing this through improved developer documentation and tutorials, abstraction layers that hide cryptographic complexity, better error messages and debugging tools, and educational programs and workshops focused on ZK development.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"the-future-of-zk-technology\">The Future of ZK Technology</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As we look toward 2026 and beyond, several trends are shaping the evolution of zero-knowledge technology.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Ethereum's Fusaka Upgrade</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ethereum's <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/11/06/fusaka-mainnet-announcement\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fusaka upgrade</a> is scheduled to activate on the mainnet on December 3, 2025. This major network upgrade includes improvements specifically designed to make zero-knowledge rollups more efficient and cost-effective.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The upgrade's most significant feature for ZK technology is the introduction of new opcodes and optimizations that will dramatically reduce the computational cost of generating zero-knowledge proofs. By making certain cryptographic operations more efficient at the protocol level, Fusaka is expected to lower ZK proving costs substantially, making ZK-rollups even more economical to operate.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, Fusaka introduces PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling), which allows the network to handle more rollup data without requiring every node to store everything. This enables Ethereum to support significantly more ZK-rollup activity, furthering the network's capacity to scale through Layer 2 solutions.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Vitalik's Long-Term Vision</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has consistently stated that zero-knowledge rollups will become the dominant scaling solution in the mid to long term as the technology matures. His ongoing research and proposals focus on making ZK proofs faster and cheaper to generate, which would further accelerate ZK-rollup adoption and make them more accessible to a wider range of applications.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Amazing to see so many major L2s now at stage 1.<br>\n<br>\nThe next goal we should shoot for is, in my view, fast (&lt;1h) withdrawal times, enabled by validity (aka ZK) proof systems.<br>\n<br>\nI consider this even more important than stage 2.<br>\n<br>\nFast withdrawal times are important because waiting a… <a href=\"https://t.co/YZs2hQ3Wrn\">https://t.co/YZs2hQ3Wrn</a></p>\n— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1953131251436818684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 6, 2025</a>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Growing Institutional Interest</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The zero-knowledge ecosystem is attracting attention from traditional financial institutions exploring blockchain technology for private, compliant transactions. Projects like <a href=\"https://corporates.db.com/files/documents/publications/db-polygo-digital-id-wp-42pp-web-secured.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Deutsche Bank's blockchain initiatives</a> have explored ZK technology for identity verification and tokenized asset transactions, demonstrating institutional interest in privacy-preserving blockchain solutions. According to <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3653478\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Communications of the ACM</a>, ZK proofs enable institutions such as banks to interact with public blockchain networks while maintaining data privacy and regulatory compliance — addressing a critical barrier to institutional adoption.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Regulatory frameworks are also evolving to accommodate privacy-preserving technologies. The U.S. GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act have provided clearer rules for digital assets and market structure, reducing uncertainty for institutions considering blockchain adoption. Meanwhile, ZK-rollup networks continue to demonstrate their capacity to handle significant transaction volume, with major networks processing over a million daily transactions.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In 2023, the question was \"Will ZK-rollups work?\" In 2025, the question is \"Which ZK ecosystem will you build on?\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With technical barriers of cost and compatibility removed through EIP-4844 and mature ZK-EVMs, zero-knowledge proofs have evolved from a niche Ethereum scaling solution into the foundational privacy and scaling layer for the entire Web3 ecosystem. The technology has proven itself in production across multiple chains, processing billions of transactions and securing billions of dollars in value.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whether you're a developer seeking scalability, an institution requiring privacy, or a user wanting instant finality and low fees, ZK technology now offers production-ready solutions across multiple blockchains. The upcoming Fusaka upgrade will further cement zero-knowledge proofs as essential infrastructure for the future of blockchain technology.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Glossary: Key Terms Explained</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EVM-Compatible</strong>: A blockchain that can execute Ethereum code with minor modifications (example: zkSync Era).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>EVM-Equivalent</strong>: A blockchain that perfectly mimics Ethereum's execution environment with no modifications required (example: Scroll, Polygon zkEVM).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Type-1 zkEVM</strong>: Fully equivalent to Ethereum with no changes to EVM specifications, prioritizing compatibility.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Type-2 zkEVM</strong>: Equivalent to EVM but with minor modifications for better proof generation efficiency.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Validity Proof</strong>: A cryptographic proof that a batch of transactions was executed correctly according to the rules.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Data Availab</strong><strong>ility</strong>: Ensuring that transaction data is accessible for verification by anyone who needs it.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Sequencer</strong>: The entity that orders and batches transactions in a rollup before they're proven.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Prover</strong>: The entity that generates zero-knowledge proofs demonstrating transaction validity.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Blob</strong>: A temporary data package introduced with EIP-4844 that rollups use to post transaction data cheaply.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Finality</strong>: The point at which a transaction is considered irreversible and permanently part of the blockchain.</p>\n<p><em>This article is only for informational purposes and should not be taken as investment advice.

Ethereum, Solana, and BNB Chain each function as separate networks with distinct architectures and native assets. Bridges act as intermediaries that facilitate asset transfers between these otherwise incompatible systems, allowing users to move assets across chains while maintaining security and decentralization</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How Bridges Work</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bridges use several mechanisms to transfer assets between chains. Traditional bridges employ a lock-and-mint model where tokens are locked on the source chain while <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-wrapped-bitcoin-wbtc-and-how-does-it-work\" target=\"_blank\">wrapped</a> versions are minted on the destination chain. To illustrate this, when you bridge ETH to Solana on a traditional bridge, that ETH would be locked on Ethereum and a corresponding amount of “wETH” will be minted on Solana. While this solution works, it has known security vulnerabilities, the locked ETH becomes a target for smart contract exploits. If the locked assets of these traditional bridges are drained, wETH will depeg and essentially become worthless. This scenario was seen during the Multichain exploit.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To counteract this vulnerability, modern native bridging solutions rely on building crosschain native token standards and employing a burn-and-mint model. LayerZero’s OFT, Wormhole’s NTT and Circle’s CCTP are examples of this model where tokens are natively burnt on one side and minted on the other in this bridging method. This solution enables tokens to exist natively across multiple chains without wrapping, maintaining a unified supply. In this solution, there are no locked assets that attackers can exploit and drain.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another popular bridging solution is intent-based bridges, which use competitive solver networks to fulfill cross-chain transfers. Instead of locking assets or requiring native token standards, users simply express their desired outcome (an \"intent\") — for example, \"I want SOL on Solana.\" Professional market makers called solvers compete to fulfill this request by providing tokens on the destination chain immediately, then claiming the user's source tokens afterward.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This approach eliminates the need for wrapped tokens entirely and often provides faster execution (1-5 minutes) with better pricing due to solver competition. Examples include Mayan Finance and deBridge's DLN (deBridge Liquidity Network). The key advantage is flexibility — intent-based bridges can work with any token without requiring special standards or creating wrapped versions.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Makes a Bridge Trustworthy?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Several factors determine a bridge's reliability and security:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Decentralization of validators/custodians:</strong> More independent validators means no single point of failure.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/total-value-locked?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Total value locked (TVL)</a>: </strong>The amount of assets secured by the bridge demonstrates user confidence and raises the stakes for maintaining security.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/how-to-read-a-smart-contract-audit?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Security audits</a>: </strong>Professional third-party reviews of the bridge's code, although not fool-proof lends better credibility.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Track record: </strong>A longer time in operation (ideally 1+ years) without major hacks or exploits is preferred.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Insurance or security funds: </strong>Protocols that maintain reserves to compensate users in case of exploits.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Financial backing:</strong> Bridges built or backed by reputable financial institutions or large VC funding suggests greater resources for security audits, bug bounties, and rapid incident response.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now let's examine the top five bridges serving the Solana ecosystem.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"1-wormhole\">1. Wormhole</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Type of bridge: </strong>Lock-and-mint with a decentralized validator network (Guardian network)</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wormhole stands as the most established and widely-used bridge connecting Solana to other blockchains. Launched in October 2021, Wormhole has evolved into a comprehensive cross-chain messaging protocol that supports not just asset transfers but also cross-chain data and application communication across more than 30 blockchain networks. Users primarily access Wormhole through <a href=\"https://portalbridge.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Portal</a>, the main user-facing application built on Wormhole's infrastructure, providing a streamlined interface for everyday users to bridge assets to and from Solana.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key Metrics</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Total Value Locked: </strong>As of writing, over <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/portal\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$2 billion</a> in assets are secured by Wormhole bridges.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Bridge volume:</strong> Processes $300-500 million in volume weekly, by far the largest as of writing.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Launch date: </strong>October 2021.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Notable team or investors:</strong> Initially developed by Jump Crypto and spun off as an independent entity in 2023; raised $225 million at a $2.5 billion valuation from Brevan Howard, Coinbase Ventures, Multicoin Capital, ParaFi, Dialectic, Borderless Capital, Arrington Capital, and Jump Trading.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How Wormhole Works</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wormhole employs a network of 19 Guardians (independent validator nodes that observe transactions on source chains and attest to their validity) who monitor transactions across connected chains. When you initiate a bridge transfer, at least 13 of the 19 Guardians must verify and sign off on the transaction before it completes on the destination chain. This creates a distributed security model where no single entity controls asset transfers.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Costs and Speed</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Typical bridging cost: </strong>Bridging cost depends on your source chain, and bridge configuration. A typical bridge of USDC to Solana from an ETH L2 such as Arbitrum would cost ~$0.50 after accounting for gas fees.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Transfer time:</strong> Generally 5-20 minutes depending on network congestion and source chain confirmation requirements. Bridging USDC via CCTP is the most cost effective but generally slower bridging times. It is worth mentioning that Portal routes bridge transactions through Mayan Finance’s Swift when the “Fastest” option is selected, which has arrival times of &lt;1 minute.<img alt=\"wormhole simulation\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34318/content_wormhole_simulation.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 1477px;\"></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Unique Features</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Native USDC Support: Wormhole partnered with Circle to enable native USDC transfers using Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), allowing users to move genuine USDC rather than wrapped versions between supported chains, eliminating the need to swap wrapped tokens back to native ones.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Comprehensive Ecosystem: Beyond simple asset bridging, Wormhole supports cross-chain governance, NFT transfers, and messaging between decentralized applications. Mayan’s Swift intent-based bridging solution utilizes Wormhole’s secure messaging network.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Recovery Ability: Wormhole suffered a massive exploit in February 2022 that resulted in $325 million in losses. The losses were fully repaid by Jump Crypto, one of their financial backers, and showcases the importance of having a strong financial backing.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"2-mayan-finance\">2. Mayan Finance</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Type of bridge: </strong>Intent-based bridge.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Mayan Finance represents a newer generation of bridging technology that uses competitive auctions rather than traditional lock-and-mint or liquidity pool models. Launched in 2022, Mayan focuses on providing the fastest possible cross-chain swaps by leveraging a network of professional solvers (specialized market makers who compete to fulfill cross-chain swap orders by providing liquidity on the destination chain).</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key Metrics</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Total Value Locked: </strong>TVL is not recorded/needed.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Bridge volume: </strong>Usage of their bridge has been growing with weekly volumes at around $200-$300 million.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Launch date:</strong> 2022.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Notable team and investors:</strong> Backed by Solana Ventures, Jump Crypto, and several DeFi-focused funds; the team includes developers with backgrounds in decentralized exchange design and cross-chain protocols.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How Mayan Works</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rather than locking assets in a bridge contract, Mayan creates an auction where solvers compete to fulfill your swap request. When you want to bridge USDC from Ethereum to Solana, Mayan broadcasts your request to its solver network. Solvers bid to complete your swap by offering you tokens on Solana immediately, then they claim your USDC on Ethereum afterward. Competition between solvers drives down costs and speeds up execution.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This creates a fundamentally different security model: instead of trusting validators or liquidity pools, you're relying on economic incentives where solvers only profit if they complete transfers honestly and competitively.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Costs and Speed</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Typical bridging cost:</strong> Mayan charges a fixed protocol fee of 0.1% of the transfer amount, which is significantly lower than many competitors. The total cost depends on the source chain's gas fees and network conditions. A simulated transaction bridging USDC from the ETH L2 Arbitrum shows costs of ~$0.50 to $1.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<div dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">\n<strong>Transfer time: </strong>&lt;1 minute in most cases, significantly faster than validator-based bridges.<img alt=\"mayan finance simulation\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34319/content_mayan_finance_simulation.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 1946px;\">\n</div>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Unique Features</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Near-instant swaps: </strong>Because solvers provide liquidity on the destination chain immediately rather than waiting for cross-chain message verification, Mayan often completes transfers in under 2 minutes, making it the fastest option for many routes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Competitive pricing: </strong>The auction mechanism ensures users typically receive better exchange rates than fixed-fee bridges, as solvers compete on price to win order flow.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Direct token swaps:</strong> Like deBridge, Mayan allows you to bridge and swap in one transaction, but with potentially better pricing due to the competitive solver market.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Lower capital requirements: </strong>Because Mayan doesn't require massive locked liquidity pools, it can support more token pairs and chain combinations than liquidity-based bridges, making it useful for bridging less common tokens.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"3-debridge\">3. deBridge</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Type of Bridge:</strong> Hybrid, utilizing both lock-and-mint and intent-based bridging.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">deBridge has emerged as a leading alternative to Wormhole, offering a different security model that emphasizes economic incentives and independent validation. Launched for Solana in 2021, deBridge focuses on creating trustless cross-chain infrastructure with strong security guarantees through economic staking mechanisms.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key Metrics</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Total Value Locked: </strong>deBridge uses a 0-TVL required, cross chain trading mechanism <a href=\"https://docs.debridge.com/dln/overview\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">(DLN)</a>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Bridge Volume: </strong>deBridge processes $200 million in weekly volume, similar to Wormhole.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Launch Date: </strong>2021 (Solana support).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Notable Team or Investors:</strong> Backed by ParaFi Capital, Animoca Brands, Huobi Ventures, and others.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How deBridge Works</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">deBridge is an intent-based bridge. Traditional bridges require you to navigate complex multi-step processes (locking tokens, minting wrapped versions, waiting for confirmations). With deBridge, you just state your desired outcome and the protocol executes it for you.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Instead of relying on locked funds in liquidity pools, deBridge uses a competitive network of professional market makers (called \"solvers\") who fulfill user requests in seconds using their own capital. This allows deBridge to operate without dedicated liquidity pools, making it safer from the large-scale exploits that have plagued traditional bridges.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Costs and Speed</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Typical bridging cost:</strong> deBridge uses a dynamic fee structure that varies based on network conditions and transfer route. The bridging fee is broken down into 2 main components, Solver gas costs and deBridge’s fee. A typical bridge of USDC from an ETH L2 would cost ~$5 in total.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Transfer time:</strong> deBridge’s key branding is “lightspeed” cross-chain transfers, meaning Instantaneous bridging times of &lt;1 second.<img alt=\"debridge simulation\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34320/content_debridge_simulation.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 500px;\"></p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Unique Features</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Instantaneous transfers: </strong>deBridge’s main selling point is its easy to use interface and “lightspeed” transfers. Expect transactions to land instantly, with few to little wait time albeit at higher transaction costs.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"4-allbridge\">4. Allbridge</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Type of bridge:</strong> Liquidity pool-based bridge</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Allbridge takes a different approach from Wormhole and deBridge by utilizing liquidity pools on each supported chain rather than relying purely on lock-and-mint mechanisms. Launched in 2021, Allbridge focuses on supporting a wide range of chains including many that other bridges don't serve, making it particularly useful for bridging from smaller or newer blockchain networks to Solana.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key Metrics</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Total Value Locked: </strong>At its peak in 2022, <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/allbridge\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Allbridge TVL</a> averaged at over $400 million. After FTX’s collapse, Allbridge has a more modest but still significant average TVL of over $40 million.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Bridge volume:</strong> <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/bridges/allbridge-core\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Allbridge</a> processes relatively lower weekly volumes of $1-2 million.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Launch date: </strong>2021.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Notable team or investors:</strong> The team operates with a relatively lower public profile compared to Wormhole and deBridge, with backing from several less established crypto investment firms such as AngelONE Capital, Black Mamba Ventures and Exnetwork Capital.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How Allbridge Works</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Allbridge maintains liquidity pools of stablecoins on each supported chain. When you bridge USDC from Polygon to Solana, you essentially swap your USDC into Allbridge's Polygon pool, and receive USDC from Allbridge's Solana pool. A small network of validators oversees pool operations and verifies cross-chain messages, using a multisig approach (a security model requiring multiple designated parties to approve transactions before they execute, similar to requiring multiple signatures on a business check).</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Costs and Speed</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Typical bridging cost: </strong>Allbridge charges a bridge fee of 0.3% of the transfer amount, paid in the same token being transferred. The same 300 USDC simulated transaction from Arbitrum to Solana shows costs of ~$2.50 in total, broken down into two parts, Allbridge’s fees as well as a relayer fee.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Transfer time: </strong>~20 minutes.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<div dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">\n<strong>Slippage considerations: </strong>Large transfers may experience slippage (the difference between expected and actual execution price due to limited liquidity), where you receive slightly less than expected if pool liquidity is limited.<img alt=\"allbridge simulation\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34321/content_allbridge_simulation.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 889px;\">\n</div>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Unique Features</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wide Chain Support: Allbridge supports bridging from numerous chains to Solana including Celo, Fuse, and other networks not covered by major bridges, making it valuable for accessing Solana from less common ecosystems.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stablecoin Focus: The protocol specializes in stablecoin transfers, optimizing its pools and fee structures for USDC, USDT, and other stablecoins rather than trying to support every token type.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lower Fees on Smaller Chains: Because many of the chains Allbridge supports have lower gas fees than Ethereum, bridging through Allbridge from these chains to Solana is often more economical than using Ethereum-based bridges.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"5-synapse-protocol\">5. Synapse Protocol</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Type of bridge: </strong>Optimistic bridge with cross-chain AMM (Automated Market Maker) integration</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Synapse Protocol offers a hybrid approach that combines bridging with decentralized exchange functionality, allowing users to not only move assets between chains but also swap between different tokens as part of the bridging process. Launched in 2021, Synapse has built a reputation for supporting a wide variety of chains with generally reliable service and competitive pricing.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key Metrics</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Total Value Locked:</strong> Once held over $1 billion in TVL in the past, <a href=\"https://defillama.com/protocol/synapse\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Synapse TVL</a> has been on a decline and currently sits at around $20 million.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Bridge volume: </strong>About $1 million in <a href=\"https://defillama.com/bridge/synapse\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">weekly volume</a>.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Launch date:</strong> 2021.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Notable team and investors:</strong> Backed by Framework Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, and several DeFi-focused investment firms; the team includes experienced developers from the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How Synapse Works</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Synapse employs an optimistic verification model where transactions are assumed to be valid and executed quickly, with validators able to dispute fraudulent transactions during a challenge period. The protocol maintains liquidity pools on each supported chain, similar to Allbridge, but also incorporates cross-chain AMM (Automated Market Maker) functionality that allows users to swap tokens across chains in a single transaction.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Costs and Speed</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Typical bridging cost: </strong>Synapse uses a multi-component fee structure that includes swap fees, bridge fees, and admin fees. The total cost varies dynamically based on network conditions, liquidity availability, and the specific transfer route. Our simulation shows total costs of ~$1.80 when bridging USDC from Arbitrum to Solana where Synapse routes the transaction through deBridge. Synapse appears to use deBridge’s slower model as evident from the non-instantaneous transfer time.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<div dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">\n<strong>Transfer time:</strong> ~1 minute.<img alt=\"Synapse simulation\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34322/content_synapse_simulation.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 636px;\">\n</div>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Unique Features</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Broad token support:</strong> Beyond just major tokens, Synapse supports a wide range of DeFi tokens and stablecoins, making it useful for bridging less common assets that other bridges may not support.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Note: Synapse has experienced significant TVL decline. Users should verify current liquidity before large transfers</em></p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"comparing-the-top-5-solana-bridges\">Comparing the Top 5 Solana Bridges</h2>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"choosing-the-right-bridge-for-your-needs\">Choosing the Right Bridge for Your Needs</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Choosing the Right Bridge for Your Needs</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>For beginners: </strong>Mayan offers the simplest one-click experience. If your chain isn't supported, try deBridge or Synapse for their straightforward interfaces. Avoid Wormhole unless necessary—the manual claim step is confusing.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>For speed: </strong>deBridge DLN is by far the fastest option (instantaneous), but Mayan Swift is also compelling as an alternative option for speed (&lt;1 min) with reasonable cost.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>For large transfers: </strong>Prioritize Wormhole or deBridge for their decentralized validator networks and proven track records with high-value assets.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>For lowest cost:</strong> Compare quotes between Allbridge (0.3% fee) and Mayan (0.1% fee), though remember that source chain gas fees often matter more than bridge fees.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>For rare/emerging blockchains:</strong> Wormhole supports 30+ chains including niche networks. Allbridge is your second-best option for unusual Layer 1s.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"security-best-practices\">Security Best Practices</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Regardless of which bridge you choose, follow these safety guidelines:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Perform test transactions:</strong> Test bridges with small amounts before transferring significant value.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Verify website addresses:</strong> Double-check that you're using official bridge websites (bookmark them after verifying).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Check liquidity: </strong>For liquidity pool bridges like Allbridge, verify sufficient pool depth before large transfers to avoid excessive slippage.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Monitor transactions: </strong>Keep track of transaction hashes on both source and destination chains.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Split up your transactions:</strong> For very large transfers, consider splitting/staggering them to avoid bad slippage due to low liquidity.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Stay informed: </strong>Follow bridge protocols on social media for security announcements and network status updates.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Blockchain bridges are essential infrastructure for accessing Solana's high-performance ecosystem from other chains. While each bridge offers different trade-offs between speed, cost, security, and decentralization, the top five bridges: Wormhole, deBridge, Mayan Finance, Allbridge and Synapse Protocol — provide reliable options for most users' needs.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As with all crypto infrastructure, no bridge is perfectly secure or risk-free. Understanding how each bridge works, following security best practices, and choosing the right tool for your specific needs will help you safely navigate the cross-chain landscape. Start with small test transactions, use reputable bridges with strong track records, and always verify you're interacting with legitimate protocol websites.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>This article is for educational and informational purposes only and should not be construed as financial advice.

That's a major&nbsp;jump from 2024, and it's attracting everyone from crypto natives to traditional banks.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most stablecoins today run on general-purpose blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. These networks are great for DeFi, NFTs, and gaming, but they weren't designed specifically for moving digital dollars around. High gas fees, network congestion, and slow transactions during peak times create friction for payment use cases.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Enter stablecoin-centric blockchains—specialized networks built with one goal in mind: making stablecoin payments work seamlessly. Think of them as the express lanes of the blockchain world, optimized specifically for moving digital money.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"what-are-stablecoin-centric-blockchains\">What Are Stablecoin-Centric Blockchains?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stablecoin-centric blockchains are Layer 1 networks built specifically for stablecoin payments. Think of them less like a \"world computer\" (Ethereum's vision) and more like specialized payment processors on blockchain rails.&nbsp;Instead of adapting general-purpose infrastructure for payments, these chains are purpose-built from the ground up for moving digital dollars efficiently.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Traditionally, stablecoins have been tokens running on general-purpose chains like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/solana\" target=\"_blank\">Solana</a>. While this worked for early adoption, it came with major drawbacks. When Ethereum <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/gas-fees?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">gas fees</a> spike during network congestion, a simple $10 USDT transfer can become uneconomical. Users also need to hold volatile crypto (like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\" target=\"_blank\">ETH</a>) just to pay transaction fees—an awkward extra step for making payments.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stablecoin chains solve the above issues&nbsp;by making stablecoins the foundation of the network itself. The key innovation: users pay transaction fees directly in stablecoins like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/usdc\" target=\"_blank\">USDC</a> or <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dai\" target=\"_blank\">xDAI</a>, not in volatile crypto tokens. This means predictable, dollar-denominated costs—essential for businesses using blockchain for payroll, invoicing, or cross-border payments.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"why-are-stablecoin-chains-growing-in-popularity\">Why Are Stablecoin Chains Growing in Popularity?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stablecoin chains solve critical pain points in both traditional finance and existing blockchain networks:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Upgrading traditional finance</strong>: These chains enable 24/7 instant settlements (versus days for bank wires), slashing cross-border costs from double-digit percentages to fractions of a cent, and providing dollar access to 1.4 billion unbanked adults worldwide. For citizens in high-inflation countries like Argentina and Turkey, accessing dollar-pegged stablecoins becomes dramatically easier and cheaper.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Fixing blockchain bottlenecks</strong>: General-purpose chains like Ethereum suffer from unpredictable gas fees that can spike above $10 during high demand, making small payments uneconomical. Stablecoin transactions also compete for block space with NFT mints and DeFi protocols, causing delays and fee surges. By creating dedicated networks, stablecoin chains eliminate this competition and integrate essential financial tools—like FX markets and compliance systems—directly into the protocol.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"key-features-of-stablecoin-chains\">Key Features of Stablecoin Chains</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These networks are defined by a handful of powerful, purpose-built features that set them apart.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Stablecoins as Native Gas Tokens</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Instead of needing to hold a volatile crypto token to pay transaction fees, users can use stablecoins directly. Plasma lets users pay with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tether\" target=\"_blank\">USDT</a>, while Tempo will support multiple stablecoins for gas payments.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This makes fees predictable, allowing users to know exactly what each transaction costs in dollar terms, removing the need to buy and hold a separate, volatile crypto asset just to use their digital dollars.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Optimized Consensus for Payments</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These chains use custom consensus mechanisms built specifically for handling high-volume payments. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Plasma uses PlasmaBFT consensus, which can process over 1,000 transactions per second with instant finality</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Arc runs on Circle's Malachite consensus engine, capable of 50,000+ TPS</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Tempo is targeting 100,000 TPS with sub-second confirmation times</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The validators on these networks are also optimized to screen transactions efficiently while preventing <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-mev-maximal-extractable-value-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">MEV (maximal extractable value)</a> attacks—basically, making sure no one can game the system to front-run payments.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Interoperability</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most stablecoin chains are <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/evm?locale=en\">EVM</a>-compatible, which means developers can deploy their Ethereum applications without rewriting code. They also include native <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-bridges-blockchain-interoperability?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">bridges</a> connecting to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major networks.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This creates a unified liquidity network where stablecoins can flow freely between chains without getting fragmented across isolated ecosystems.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Native Stablecoin Infrastructure</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stablecoin chains integrate specialized features directly into their protocols:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Transaction batching</strong>: Networks like Tempo support sending multiple transactions in a single batch, reducing costs and improving efficiency for operations like payroll or recurring payments.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Built-in stablecoin exchanges</strong>: Rather than requiring external DEXs, these chains include native swap mechanisms. Arc features an institutional-grade FX engine for converting between USDC and EURC with real-time price discovery. Tempo allows users to swap stablecoins natively with low fees, including custom-issued ones.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Cross-chain bridges</strong>: Native bridges connect stablecoin chains to other networks. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/chains/xdai\" target=\"_blank\">Gnosis Chain</a> provides integrated bridges to Ethereum and other blockchains, while Plasma includes a Bitcoin bridge. These native integrations are more efficient and secure than third-party bridging solutions.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Because these features are built into the protocol layer, they operate more efficiently and securely than external implementations added on top of general-purpose blockchains.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"stablecoin-chains-vs-traditional-layer-1s\">Stablecoin Chains vs. Traditional Layer 1s</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The rise of stablecoin chains highlights a classic engineering trade-off: flexibility versus optimization. General-purpose L1s like Ethereum are the Swiss Army knives of the blockchain world—they can do almost anything, but they aren't perfectly optimized for a single task.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Stablecoin chains are specialized. They sacrifice the ability to do everything in order to do one thing—process stable value transfers—with unparalleled efficiency.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"top-stablecoin-chains-to-watch\">Top Stablecoin Chains to Watch</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The race to build the dominant stablecoin chain is heating up.

Instead of choosing one stablecoin to favor, it created an open platform where any stablecoin can thrive. The chain provides the infrastructure—bridges, advanced smart contracts, liquidity layers—but doesn't favor a specific stablecoin.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For developers who want to build stablecoin applications without being locked into a specific issuer's ecosystem, Gnosis offers a credibly neutral alternative.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"challenges-facing-stablecoin-chains\">Challenges Facing Stablecoin Chains</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Regulatory complexity</strong>: While frameworks like MiCA (Europe) and the GENIUS Act (U.S.) bring clarity, they impose strict compliance burdens for reserves, transparency, and AML/KYC that vary across jurisdictions.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Security and stability risks</strong>: Stablecoin chains are prime targets for hackers, with vulnerabilities in smart contracts, cross-chain bridges (the source of crypto's largest hacks), and user-facing phishing attacks. Even fully-backed stablecoins face de-pegging risks during crises, as seen with USDC during the Silicon Valley Bank collapse in 2023.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Fragmentation and competition</strong>: As more chains launch, stablecoin liquidity risks becoming trapped in siloed ecosystems. Complex bridges between chains reintroduce the friction these networks aimed to eliminate. Additionally, over 130 countries are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) that could compete directly with private stablecoins, reshaping the digital finance landscape.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p>Over $50 billion in stablecoin transactions happen every day, with daily trading volume on exchanges averaging $150 billion. The demand is clearly there. But stablecoins have been succeeding despite the limitations of general-purpose blockchains, not because of them. Technical complexity, such as wallet management and gas fees, across all chains create friction that limits mainstream adoption.</p>\n<p>Stablecoin-centric blockchains represent a bet that specialization beats generalization. By focusing exclusively on making digital dollars work better, these networks can optimize every part of the stack—from consensus mechanisms to gas payment models to compliance tools.</p>\n<p>The big question is whether this matters in practice. Will people actually switch to using specialized stablecoin chains? Or will the network effects of existing blockchains prove too strong to overcome?</p>\n<p>Early signs are promising:&nbsp;Plasma attracted $13 billion in bridged TVL within weeks of launch,&nbsp;Tempo has backing from some of the biggest names in both traditional finance and crypto, and Circle is betting its flagship product on Arc's success.</p>\n<p>For stablecoins to truly compete with traditional payment systems, they need to be at least as easy and cost-effective to use. That's exactly what stablecoin chains are trying to deliver. Whether they succeed will depend on real-world adoption, regulatory developments, and their ability to deliver on the promise of near-instant, near-free payments at global scale.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Disclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

Bitcoin blocks have limited space and are produced only every 10 minutes on average, but users want to send transactions at any time. Without mempools, transactions would either be lost, or the network would need some other way to handle this timing mismatch. The mempool solves this by providing a waiting area where transactions can be stored until miners can include them in blocks.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If demand for block space exceeds what miners can process, how can users&nbsp; ensure that their transaction is processed in a timely manner? This brings us to our next point which is how a user submits their transaction along with miner incentives to get their transactions through.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How Bitcoin Processes Your Transactions</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To understand how users submit their transactions and get them processed in the mempool, let's follow a Bitcoin transaction from start to finish.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Step 1: Transaction Creation and Broadcasting</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When you click \"send\" in your Bitcoin wallet, several things happen:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Your wallet creates a transaction containing details like the recipient's address, the amount being sent, and a transaction fee (the \"tip\" you pay to miners).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The transaction is digitally signed using your private key (a secret code that proves you own the Bitcoin).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The transaction is broadcast to the Bitcoin network, spreading from node to node (network operators) like ripples in a pond. Each node that receives and validates your transaction will add it to its own mempool, where it waits until a miner picks it up for processing.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Bitcoin nodes receive the transaction, they validate it to ensure the authenticity of the transaction. The network verifies that:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You actually own the Bitcoin you're trying to send.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You haven't already spent the same Bitcoin elsewhere (double-spending prevention).</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The transaction follows Bitcoin's rules and format (network consensus).</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Step 3: Mempool Entry</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once validated, the transaction enters the mempool, where it remains until it's picked up by miners. Here's what's important to understand:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Each Bitcoin node has its own mempool—there isn't one central waiting room, but thousands of individual ones across the network.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Mempools sync with each other by sharing transaction information, though they may contain slightly different sets of transactions.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Transactions can remain in the mempool for minutes, hours, or even days depending on network conditions and fees.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Step 4: Miner Selection and Block Creation</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Miners select unconfirmed transactions from their mempools and fit them into a single Bitcoin block. This process is like a chef selecting orders from the kitchen queue and fitting them onto a single tray.</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Miners prioritize transactions with higher fees because they earn these fees as payment for their work.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Block space is limited – each Bitcoin block can only hold about 1-4 million bytes (units of data size) worth of transactions.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Miners compete to solve a mathematical puzzle (proof of work) to earn the right (and a Bitcoin reward) to add their block to the blockchain.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Step 5: Confirmation and Mempool Clearing</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When a miner successfully mines a block, the transactions included in that block are cleared from each node's mempool, updating the blockchain and validating those transactions:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">The block is broadcast to the entire network for verification.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">All transactions in that block are confirmed and become part of the permanent Bitcoin blockchain record.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">These transactions are removed from all mempools across the network.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You receive confirmation that your Bitcoin has been sent.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"bitcoin-transaction-priority-system\">Bitcoin Transaction Priority System</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here's how Bitcoin's fee-based priority system works and how users can leverage it to get faster processing.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Fee Market System</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin operates on a fee market where users compete for limited block space. Miners prioritize transactions based on factors like transaction fees and size, with transactions with higher fees usually completed faster since miners prioritize them to maximize their profits. This system is why transaction fees can skyrocket during periods of network congestion.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Transaction fees are measured in \"satoshis per virtual byte\" (sat/vB), where:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Satoshis are the smallest unit of Bitcoin (1 Bitcoin = 100,000,000 satoshis)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Virtual bytes represent the data size of your transaction</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Higher sat/vB rates = faster confirmation times</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What Determines Transaction Size?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A transaction's size is not determined by how much BTC it transfers, but by how many inputs, outputs and signatures it has, and which address type it uses.</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Inputs</strong> = the sources of Bitcoin you're spending (like combining coins from different pockets)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Outputs</strong> = the destinations (recipient address plus change back to you)</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Address types</strong> = newer address formats like <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-bitcoin-wallet-address\" target=\"_blank\">SegWit</a> create smaller transactions</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Prioritization Factors</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Miners consider several factors when selecting transactions:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Fee rate (sat/vB)</strong> – the primary factor determining priority.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Transaction age</strong> – older transactions may get slight preference.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Child-pays-for-parent (CPFP)</strong> – When a transaction is stuck due to low fees, the recipient can create a new transaction (the 'child') that spends from the stuck transaction (the 'parent') using a much higher fee rate. Since miners want to collect the higher fee from the child transaction, they must process both the parent and child transactions together, effectively speeding up the stuck parent transaction.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Replace-by-fee (RBF)</strong> – Another method that allows users to increase fees on unconfirmed transactions to speed up transaction times.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Network Congestion Effects</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">During busy periods (like market rallies or major news events):</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Mempool size increases as more transactions compete for block space.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Required fees rise as users bid against each other for faster confirmation.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Lower-fee transactions get delayed or may eventually be dropped from mempools.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Confirmation times become unpredictable.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"mempool-on-other-blockchains\">Mempool on Other Blockchains</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While Bitcoin popularized the mempool concept, other blockchains have implemented their own variations – each with unique characteristics:</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Ethereum</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ethereum has its own mempool system where transactions compete for inclusion in blocks.

Unlike networks with limited transactional throughput that attempt to retrofit scaling technologies to address ever-growing mempools, Solana has been engineered since conception with optimizations to enable huge transactional throughput.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solana doesn't have an in-protocol memory pool (mempool). Instead, transactions are streamed directly to the current block leader; only they can view the transactions before execution.

Alternatively, a much more modern and user-friendly way to speed up your transaction is by using mempool.space’s “Accelerator” feature.</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Go to Mempool.space, key in your Bitcoin wallet address.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Find the transaction ID (TXID) of your stuck transaction, and click into it to check on its transaction status.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<div dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">After confirming that the transaction is stuck, or if the confirmation time is unsatisfactory, you can proceed to speed up the transaction.&nbsp;<img alt=\"mempool accelerator prompt\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34085/content_mempool_accelerator.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 784px;\">\n</div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Click the “Accelerate” button.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<div dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">You will be prompted with several payment options to accelerate your transaction, either through a Lightning Network payment or through Google/Apple Pay.&nbsp;<img alt=\"mempool accelerator payment page\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34086/content_accelerator_payment_page.webp\" style=\"width: 1200px; height: 679px;\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.rhett.blog/mempool-accelerator/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.rhett.blog/mempool-accelerator/</a>&nbsp;</div>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">After payment is confirmed, your transaction is accelerated and more likely to be picked up by other Bitcoin miners.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Bitcoin mempool is a crucial component that enables the world's largest cryptocurrency network to process millions of transactions securely and efficiently. By understanding how transactions flow from your wallet into the mempool, get prioritized by miners, and ultimately become confirmed on the blockchain, you can make more informed decisions about fees and timing.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whether you're a casual Bitcoin user wanting to avoid overpaying for transactions or a developer building applications on top of Bitcoin, understanding the mempool helps you navigate the network more effectively. As Bitcoin continues to mature, the mempool will remain central to how the network manages transaction flow and maintains its decentralized, trustless operation. By thinking of it as a digital waiting room with clear priority rules, you can better understand and work with this essential piece of Bitcoin's infrastructure.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>This article is for educational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

Before Bitcoin, Finney established himself as a leading cryptographer by creating the first reusable proof-of-work system in 2004. He also worked on the Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) encryption software, a widely-used tool that protects digital communications from surveillance and hacking.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Bitcoin emerged, Finney became its first supporter outside of Satoshi Nakamoto, downloading the software immediately upon release, receiving the first Bitcoin transaction, and spending crucial early months testing the network and reporting bugs that helped stabilize the revolutionary technology. Hal Finney remained actively involved in Bitcoin development from 2009 until his death in 2014 from complications related to ALS.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"hal-finney-s-bitcoin-journey\">Hal Finney's Bitcoin Journey</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, let’s look at Hal Finney and his contributions to Bitcoin and blockchain technology.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Pre-Bitcoin (2004-2008)</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before Bitcoin existed, Finney created the first <a href=\"https://nakamotoinstitute.org/finney/rpow/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reusable proof-of-work (RPoW)</a> system in 2004, which allowed digital tokens to be transferred from one person to another without being duplicated or counterfeited. Unlike Bitcoin's proof-of-work system that uses a distributed network of miners, Finney's RPoW relied on trusted but centralized hardware servers to validate transactions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finney's RPoW system served as a crucial stepping stone, proving that digital scarcity could be created and maintained, which directly influenced Bitcoin's eventual decentralized design.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Early Bitcoin Testing and Validation (2009-2010)</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper in late 2008, Finney, having worked on proof of work systems previously, immediately recognized its significance. On January 11, 2009, he posted one of Bitcoin's most famous early tweets, “Running bitcoin”.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Running bitcoin</p>\n— halfin (@halfin) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/halfin/status/1110302988?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 11, 2009</a>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The next day, he received the first Bitcoin transaction from Satoshi Nakamoto, becoming Bitcoin's first user outside of its creator. During this critical period, Finney tested the network, reported bugs, and provided feedback that helped stabilize Bitcoin's early code.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Continued Development Despite ALS (2009-2014)</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even after being diagnosed with ALS in 2009, Finney continued contributing to Bitcoin development until his death in 2014. Despite his declining health, he used his Bitcoin holdings to pay for medical expenses and remained an active voice in the community, demonstrating both the practical utility of the cryptocurrency and his unwavering belief in its future.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"is-hal-finney-satoshi-nakamoto-himself\">Is Hal Finney Satoshi Nakamoto Himself?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The relationship between Hal Finney and the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto remains one of Bitcoin's most fascinating stories. Many believe that Finney might have been Satoshi Nakamoto himself.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There were some intriguing clues that suggested that Hal Finney was indeed Satoshi Nakamoto. Firstly, in the town where Finney lived, was a Japanese American man by the name of “Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto”, many theorized that Finney used Dorian’s name as an inspiration for the pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. Secondly, Finney’s retirement from his corporate work at PGP in 2011 coincided similarly with the time of Satoshi Nakamoto’s last email correspondence. Despite these rumors, there was overall no conclusive evidence that Finney was Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These rumors were debunked by Jameson Lopp, the co-founder of Casa, a Bitcoin custody firm. Lopp revealed in a blog post that Finney was competing in a 10 mile race at the same time when Satoshi Nakamoto was responding to emails and transacting on the Bitcoin blockchain, providing strong evidence that they were two separate individuals.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"hal-finney-s-health-journey-and-determination\">Hal Finney's Health Journey and Determination</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In October 2009, Finney announced that he had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in August 2009. ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that attacks nerve cells controlling muscle movement) would gradually rob Finney of his physical abilities, but never his intellectual curiosity or determination.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite ALS slowing his ability to code, he still loved programming and the goals it provided. He continued to program until his death, working on experimental software called bcflick, which uses Trusted Computing to strengthen Bitcoin wallets.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\"Today, I am essentially paralyzed. I am fed through a tube, and my breathing is assisted through another tube,\" <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=155054.0\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Finney wrote</a> on the Bitcoin Talk Forum in March 2013. \"It's been an adjustment, but my life is not too bad… I still love programming and it gives me goals\".</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tragically, during the last year of his life, the Finneys received anonymous calls demanding an extortion fee of 1,000 bitcoin and became victims of swatting—a dangerous hoax where criminals call police claiming a violent crime is occurring at the victim's address, hoping to provoke an armed response. Extortionists demanded more bitcoins than Finney had left after using most of them to cover medical expenses in 2013.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"legacy-and-wealth-the-impact-he-left-behind\">Legacy and Wealth: The Impact He Left Behind</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When Finney died in Phoenix, Arizona, on August 28, 2014, he was cryopreserved by the Alcor Life Extension Foundation – cryopreservation (a process of freezing bodies at extremely low temperatures with the hope that future technology might restore life). This final act reflected his lifelong optimism about technology's potential to solve seemingly impossible problems.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Financial Legacy</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Bitcoin he had mined came in handy, as his family was able to sell the coins to arrange his medical care. While exact figures remain private, some analysts suggest that he accumulated a significant amount of bitcoins through his involvement in early mining and close interaction with Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to some <a href=\"https://cryptonews.net/news/bitcoin/29860895/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">blockchain analytics firms</a>, 46 BTC worth around $1.2 million at the time was reportedly transferred from an address associated with Finney to a cryptocurrency exchange in 2024, though this information has not been independently verified by major news outlets.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Family and Personal Legacy</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finney was married to Fran Finney and they had two children, Erin and Jason. His wife Fran Finney has established the annual Running Bitcoin Challenge (paying homage to his “Running Bitcoin” quote), the challenge is a fundraiser for ALS research and Fran continues to host the challenge annually, with the most recent challenge held in <a href=\"https://x.com/franfinney/status/1885564736777211915\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">February 2025</a>.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Technological and Philosophical Impact</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finney's vision of a world where technology does not infringe on people's rights to privacy and freedom is still relevant today, especially to those in cryptocurrency and privacy advocacy (13). His contributions extend far beyond Bitcoin:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Cryptographic innovation:</strong> His reusable proof-of-work system showed how computational work could be reused, building on Adam Back's Hashcash algorithm and addressing early concerns about energy-intensive systems.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Privacy advocacy:</strong> His work on anonymous remailers and PGP demonstrated how cryptography could protect individual privacy in an increasingly digital world.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Community building: </strong>Hal Finney was universally well-liked in the Bitcoin community from week one, embodying the collaborative spirit that would become essential to open-source cryptocurrency development.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While debates rage about Satoshi's identity, one fact remains undisputed: without Hal Finney, Bitcoin might have remained an obscure white paper rather than the financial revolution we know today. His story represents the best of the cryptocurrency movement – brilliant technical innovation combined with unwavering dedication to helping others succeed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finney's life demonstrates that the most important technological revolutions often depend not just on brilliant inventors, but on dedicated individuals willing to take risks on unproven ideas. He was comfortable with his legacy, and what a legacy it is – a foundation of trust, technical excellence, and unwavering optimism that continues to inspire the cryptocurrency community today.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">From his early games programming to his final contributions typed through eye-tracking technology, Hal Finney's journey reminds us that technology's greatest power lies not in creating wealth, but in expanding human potential and possibility. His willingness to test, debug, and believe in Bitcoin when others were skeptical helped transform a radical experiment into the global phenomenon that has opened new financial possibilities for millions of people worldwide.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>This article is for educational purposes only and is not financial advice.

But not everyone has the technical expertise or desire to be personally responsible for their own Bitcoin, more so if the wealth they manage is not their own. In this article we deep dive into the way institutions store Bitcoin and how they differ dramatically from personal storage, involving sophisticated custody solutions (professional storage services), multi-signature wallets (requiring multiple keys to authorize transactions), and comprehensive risk management frameworks.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"how-everyday-users-store-bitcoin\">How Everyday Users Store Bitcoin</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin exists as entries on a public ledger called the blockchain, rather than as physical files. Ownership is determined by private keys—unique digital codes that act like passwords to prove you own the wallet holding the cryptocurrency. To store these passwords and keep their Bitcoin secure, individual Bitcoin holders typically use two main storage methods:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hot wallets are connected to the internet and include mobile apps like Coinbase Wallet or browser extensions like MetaMask. These offer convenience for frequent transactions but carry higher security risks since they're vulnerable to hacking attempts. Think of hot wallets like carrying cash in your physical wallet—convenient for daily use but you wouldn't store your life savings there.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cold wallets store private keys offline on physical devices like Ledger or Trezor hardware wallets, or even paper printouts. These provide superior security since hackers cannot access offline devices, but they're less convenient for frequent trading. Cold storage is like keeping valuables in a bank vault—extremely secure but requires effort to access.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most individuals manage their own private keys through these wallets, taking personal responsibility for backup and security. This self-custody approach gives complete control but places the entire burden of security on the user.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"institutional-level-custody-solutions\">Institutional-Level Custody Solutions</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Institutions face fundamentally different challenges than individual users. Managing millions or billions of dollars of customer funds in Bitcoin requires enterprise-grade security, regulatory compliance, operational controls, and insurance coverage that direct-to-consumer solutions cannot provide.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Qualified custodians like Coinbase, BitGo, Anchorage Digital, and Fidelity offer institutional-grade Bitcoin storage services. These providers typically offer:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Segregated cold storage keeps each institution's Bitcoin completely separate and offline, often in geographically distributed locations. Unlike consumer cold wallets, institutional cold storage uses Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) - tamper-resistant computing devices that generate and protect private keys with military-grade security.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Comprehensive insurance coverage protects against loss, theft, or technical failures. <a href=\"https://citizenx.com/insights/best-crypto-custodians/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Leading providers</a> offer insurance coverage ranging from $75 million to $320 million, far exceeding what individual users can obtain.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Regulatory compliance ensures custodians meet strict financial regulations including anti-money laundering (AML) requirements, know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, and regular audits. This compliance framework is essential for institutional adoption and regulatory legitimacy.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">24/7 monitoring and support provides continuous surveillance of stored assets and immediate response to any security concerns - a level of service impossible for individual users to maintain.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Emerging Custody Models</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Collaborative custody represents a hybrid approach where institutions maintain some control while partnering with professional custodians. Companies like Unchained Capital offer 2-of-3 multisig setups where institutions hold two keys and Unchained holds one as a co-signer, providing professional backup while maintaining primary control.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Self-custody infrastructure providers like <a href=\"https://www.turnkey.com/blog/bitcoin-wallets-secure-institutional-holdings\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Turnkey</a> enable institutions to maintain full control of their Bitcoin while leveraging professional-grade security tools. Turnkey's platform allows institutions to deploy scalable wallet systems without building everything in-house, using secure enclaves for private key management.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"multi-signature-wallet-systems\">Multi-Signature Wallet Systems</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Multi-signature (multisig) wallets represent the gold standard for institutional Bitcoin storage. Unlike traditional wallets requiring only one private key, multisig wallets require multiple keys to authorize any transaction.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most common institutional setup is 2-of-3 multisig, where three keys are created but only two are needed to spend Bitcoin. This configuration protects against both theft (single key compromise cannot drain funds) and loss (losing one key doesn't make Bitcoin inaccessible). For larger institutions, 3-of-5 or even 5-of-7 configurations provide additional security layers.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Geographic distribution is a key advantage of institutional multisig. Keys might be stored in separate secure facilities across different countries, ensuring that no single location failure or regulatory action can compromise the entire holdings.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Role-based access allows institutions to assign different keys to different executives or departments, creating an authorization hierarchy similar to traditional corporate financial controls. For example, the CFO, CTO, and board representative might each control one key in a 2-of-3 setup.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Advanced Multisig Features</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Policy engines allow institutions to set automated rules for Bitcoin transactions. These might include spending limits, time delays for large transactions, or requirements for additional approvals above certain thresholds.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Backup and recovery systems ensure institutions can regain access even if multiple keys are lost. Professional custodians maintain secure backup procedures and can assist with key replacement without compromising the multisig wallet's integrity.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"risk-management-and-security-frameworks\">Risk Management and Security Frameworks</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Institutional Bitcoin storage involves comprehensive risk management far beyond what individual users need to consider. Here are some of the challenges institutions will need to account for.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Operational security: Employee background checks, separation of duties, and strict access controls. High-value users face sophisticated threats including phishing, social engineering, and even physical kidnapping attempts, requiring institutional-grade protective measures.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Technical security: Hardware and software protections. Modern custody solutions use multi-party computation (MPC) and AI-driven transaction analysis for bank-grade security and compliance, technologies unavailable to individual users.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Insurance and liability: Firms will need to insure themselves against various loss scenarios including custody provider bankruptcy, technical failures, or security breaches.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Security certification: Institutional custodians must undergo rigorous certification processes before they are allowed to operate. Some certifications they may require include SOC 1 and ISO 27001 compliance.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"insurance-coverage-and-risk-protection\">Insurance Coverage and Risk Protection</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hacks and scams are commonplace in the world of crypto, combined with the fact that transactions on the Bitcoin network are irreversible, meaning that institutions need to insure themselves against the worst case scenario. These insurance policies typically protect against two main risks.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Crime insurance covers theft, fraud, and unauthorized access, with leading providers like Coinbase Prime (previously Coinbase Custody) offering up to <a href=\"https://citizenx.com/insights/best-crypto-custodians/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$320 million in coverage</a>. This insurance specifically protects against external hacking attempts, insider threats, and physical theft of storage devices. However, coverage typically excludes losses due to market volatility, regulatory changes, or client operational errors.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Technology errors and omissions (E&amp;O) insurance protects against losses from system failures, software bugs, or procedural mistakes in custody operations. This coverage becomes crucial given the irreversible nature of Bitcoin transactions.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"operational-considerations-and-cost-structures\">Operational Considerations and Cost Structures</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These added protections and certifications translate into significantly higher costs and complexity compared to individual storage solutions.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Costs include annual custody fees, setup charges, and transaction fees. These costs are significantly higher than individual hardware wallets but include professional security, insurance, and regulatory compliance that individuals cannot access.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Complex Processes mean institutions can't simply move Bitcoin instantly like individuals can. Large withdrawals may require multiple approvals and can take hours or days to complete, ensuring security but reducing flexibility.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Integration Challenges arise because institutions must connect Bitcoin custody with their existing accounting systems and risk management tools. This requires significant technical work and ongoing maintenance that individual users don't face.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Geographic Complexity affects institutions operating across multiple countries, as they must navigate different regulations and may need custody providers with global presence—adding cost and operational overhead that individual users avoid.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"the-future-of-institutional-bitcoin-storage\">The Future of Institutional Bitcoin Storage</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The institutional Bitcoin custody landscape continues evolving rapidly. <a href=\"https://www.ainvest.com/news/bank-strategic-reentry-bitcoin-custody-etf-integration-catalyst-institutional-adoption-2509/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">86%</a> of institutional investors now allocate to digital assets, driven by SEC-approved Bitcoin ETFs and secure custody innovations. Traditional financial institutions increasingly offer Bitcoin custody services alongside conventional asset management.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Technology improvements like faster multisig implementations, improved hardware security, and better user interfaces are making institutional custody more accessible and cost-effective. Regulatory clarity removes barriers that previously prevented institutional adoption, while increased insurance availability provides the risk mitigation institutions require.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As Bitcoin transitions from speculative asset to institutional treasury holding, custody solutions will likely become even more sophisticated, potentially incorporating features like programmable spending policies, automated compliance reporting, and seamless integration with traditional financial infrastructure.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The evolution from individual self-custody to institutional-grade custody solutions represents Bitcoin's maturation as an asset class. While the fundamental cryptographic principles remain unchanged, the infrastructure surrounding Bitcoin storage has developed into a comprehensive ecosystem capable of serving the world's largest financial institutions with the security, compliance, and operational efficiency they demand.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>This article is for educational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

These are proposals that change aspects of the Bitcoin protocol — transaction, block validation or encoding schemes. These require greater community consensus from both the developers and network validators because they affect how Bitcoin fundamentally operates. Think of these as constitutional amendments for Bitcoin. For example, BIP 141 (SegWit) changed how transaction data is structured and validated, requiring network-wide consensus to activate.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Informational BIPs</strong> serve an educational purpose. They offer general guidelines to the community but do not introduce a new feature and are, therefore, not required to gain consensus within the community. These are like advisory documents that help standardize best practices across the Bitcoin ecosystem. For example, BIP 39 standardized the format for mnemonic seed phrases, ensuring that recovery words work consistently across different wallet applications.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Process BIPs</strong> outline procedural changes. Also called consensus BIPs, these seek to change a process, and similar to standard BIPs, require universal consensus despite containing changes outside of the Bitcoin protocol. These establish the rules for how Bitcoin's governance itself should work. For example, BIP 1 established the framework for how all future BIPs should be formatted and submitted, essentially creating the rules for Bitcoin's improvement process itself.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"people-also-ask-how-do-bitcoin-improvement-proposals-work\">People Also Ask: How Do Bitcoin Improvement Proposals Work?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let's say you're a developer with an idea to improve the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin Improvement Proposals work as a structured system that takes your idea through several stages: drafting, community review, revision, and potential adoption. In this section, we'll break down how this process functions and what happens at each step.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Life Cycle of a BIP</h3>\n<img src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/34051/content_image2.webp\" alt=\"the life cycle of a BIP\" />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Source: <a href=\"https://bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/bitcoin-improvement-proposals\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/bitcoin-improvement-proposals</a></p>\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Informal discussion:</strong> Ideas typically start as informal discussions on Bitcoin mailing lists, forums, or crypto Twitter (X). The community provides feedback, refining good ideas and filtering out problematic ones.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Formal submission:</strong> Refined ideas are written up according to the standardized BIP format and submitted to the bitcoin-dev mailing list (currently hosted on Google Groups). After review, they receive a BIP number and are published to the official <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips?tab=readme-ov-file#readme\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub repository.</a></p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Community review:</strong> The Bitcoin community—developers, miners, and users—evaluates the proposal's technical merits and implications. This consensus-building process can take months or years, as some ideas require extensive refinement or wait for the right timing.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Implementation and activation:</strong> Approved BIPs move to coding and testing. For protocol changes, activation requires careful coordination through mechanisms like miner signaling (miners indicating support) to ensure the network doesn't split during deployment.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"notable-bips\">Notable BIPs</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Several BIPs have fundamentally shaped Bitcoin's development, demonstrating the power of this decentralized governance system. These landmark proposals show how the BIP process can deliver significant improvements while maintaining Bitcoin's core principles.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The First BIP: Defining the Process</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The first-ever BIP created by Amir Taaki, a British-Iranian programmer and early Bitcoin developer, BIP 001 was essentially a proposal on what a BIP should be. This foundational document, submitted in 2011, established the framework that all future BIPs would follow.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">BIP 1 defined the structure, workflow, and types of BIPs that we still use today. It provided a detailed presentation of what BIPs should look like, defining the format and structure of all the BIPs to come. Without this initial framework, Bitcoin's development would lack the organized, transparent process that has enabled its continued evolution.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">SegWit (BIP 141): Scaling Bitcoin</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the most significant and controversial BIPs in Bitcoin's history was Segregated Witness <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-bitcoin-wallet-address\" target=\"_blank\">(SegWit)</a>, introduced in BIP 141. SegWit was introduced by Peter Wuille and addressed the problem of transaction malleability (a technical issue where transaction signatures could be altered without changing the transaction's validity) and increased the capacity of the Bitcoin network.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Transaction malleability made it difficult to build reliable Layer-2 solutions like the Lightning Network because <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/transaction-id-txid\" target=\"_blank\">transaction IDs</a> could be changed after signing. SegWit solved this by moving signature data to a separate section of each transaction, which also created more space for transactions in each block.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This change increased Bitcoin's transaction capacity and made the Lightning Network possible. The upgrade was controversial, many miners initially opposed it, but SegWit was finally activated in August 2017.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Taproot (BIP 340-342): Privacy and Smart Contracts</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Taproot upgrade, implemented through BIPs 340, 341, and 342, represents one of the most significant improvements to Bitcoin since SegWit. BIP 341 is the main proposal in which the \"Taproot upgrade\" is named after, introducing a general framework that allows for the integration of several complementary mechanism proposals.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Taproot brought three major improvements:</p>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<li>\n<strong>Schnorr signatures (BIP 340)</strong> replaced Bitcoin's older signature system with a more efficient one. Schnorr Signatures were introduced in 2021 through BIP 340 and enabled smaller signatures, making transactions more compact, and allowed for batch verification where multiple signatures could be verified simultaneously.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Enhanced privacy and efficiency (BIP 341)</strong> made complex transactions look identical to simple ones. Taproot lets us merge the traditionally separate pay-to-pubkey and pay-to-scripthash policies, making all outputs spendable by either a key or (optionally) a script, and indistinguishable from each other.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Improved Smart Contracts (BIP 342) </strong>enhanced Bitcoin's ability to execute more complex transactions. BIP 342 updated Bitcoin's programming language to work with the new Schnorr signatures and Taproot features, making smart contracts more efficient and flexible.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Other Consequential BIPs</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">BIP 32 introduced Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets, which allow users to generate multiple Bitcoin addresses from a single seed phrase. This innovation dramatically improved wallet security and user experience.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">BIP 39 established the standard for mnemonic seed phrases - those 12 or 24-word recovery phrases that most Bitcoin wallets use today.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"how-does-bitcoin-s-decentralized-development-work\">How Does Bitcoin's Decentralized Development Work?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While a smaller group of Core developers write most of Bitcoin's code and propose BIPs, the activation of these proposals is entirely decided by Bitcoin miners and other network participants (non-mining network nodes).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This system ensures that no single entity can unilaterally change Bitcoin. A BIP's journey from concept to code is governed by community consensus, not a central authority. This process requires broad agreement from various stakeholders in the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The deliberate pace of Bitcoin development reflects this democratic approach. As a new monetary system, Bitcoin's reputation is still being established, and the security of the network is paramount to maintaining trust. Thus, Bitcoin's development process is intentionally slow and deliberate.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"challenges-and-benefits-of-the-bip-process\">Challenges and Benefits of the BIP Process</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The BIP system comes with both advantages and limitations that reflect the trade-offs inherent in decentralized governance.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Benefits</h3>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<li>\n<strong>Transparency and openness:</strong> BIPs provide a formal pathway for introducing critical upgrades and maintaining protocol stability. Every proposal is public, and anyone can review and comment on proposed changes.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Security through consensus: </strong>The requirement for broad agreement helps prevent hasty changes that could compromise Bitcoin's security or stability.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Innovation without central control:</strong> The system allows for continuous improvement while maintaining Bitcoin's decentralized nature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Challenges</h3>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<li>\n<strong>Slow decision making:</strong> Reaching community agreement can be a lengthy affair, meaning important upgrades may take years to activate. This can frustrate those who want rapid innovation.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Potential for conflict:</strong> Contentious proposals can create deep divisions within the community, sometimes resulting in network splits, like the creation of Bitcoin Cash. The block size debate that led to SegWit's contentious activation exemplifies this challenge.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Technical barriers:</strong> While anyone can propose a BIP, the technical nature of most proposals can make it difficult for non-technical community members to fully participate in discussions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"the-future-of-bitcoin-through-bips\">The Future of Bitcoin Through BIPs</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The BIP process will continue to shape Bitcoin's evolution as new challenges and opportunities emerge. Current areas of active discussion include improvements to privacy, scalability solutions, and enhanced smart contract capabilities.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As of 2025, there is significant community interest in proposals related to privacy, scalability, and programmability. The community continues to explore ways to improve Bitcoin while maintaining its core properties of decentralization, security, and censorship resistance.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The success of major upgrades like SegWit and Taproot demonstrates that the BIP process, despite its challenges, can deliver significant improvements to Bitcoin. These upgrades have enabled new applications, improved efficiency, and enhanced privacy, all while maintaining the network's fundamental characteristics.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin Improvement Proposals represent a unique experiment in decentralized governance, allowing a global community to collectively steer the development of a monetary system worth trillions of dollars. The BIP process embodies the principles that make Bitcoin special: openness, transparency, and resistance to centralized control.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Understanding BIPs gives you insight not just into Bitcoin's technical evolution, but into how decentralized systems can govern themselves without traditional authority structures. As Bitcoin continues to mature, the BIP process will remain the primary mechanism through which the community shapes its future.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whether you're a Bitcoin user curious about upcoming changes, a developer interested in contributing to the ecosystem, or simply someone fascinated by decentralized governance, following the BIP process offers a window into the future of money and technology.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>This article is for educational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

In September 2025, this 60-year-old manufacturing company completely pivoted to become the world's largest corporate holder of <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana\" target=\"_blank\">Solana (SOL)</a>, acquiring over 6.8 million tokens worth approximately $1.58 billion.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"what-is-forward-industries-ford-us\">What Is Forward Industries (FORD.US)?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Forward Industries was founded in 1961 as a designer and distributor of custom protective carrying solutions, serving medical and technology companies for over six decades. The company manufactured cases for devices like diabetic monitoring kits, barcode scanners, and tablets from its headquarters in Hauppauge, New York.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In September 2025, Forward Industries executed a complete corporate transformation, abandoning its legacy manufacturing business to become what it calls \"the leading <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/treasuries/solana\" target=\"_blank\">Solana treasury company</a>.\" This pivot represents one of the most dramatic business model changes in recent corporate history, shifting from physical goods manufacturing to digital asset management.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why Solana?&nbsp;</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Forward Industries is unique in its focus&nbsp;on Solana, and its $1.58 billion SOL acquisition represents one of the largest single-asset treasury pivots outside of Bitcoin.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">According to Forward Industries, it is <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250910472556/en/Forward-Industries-Closes-$1.65-Billion-Private-Placement-in-Cash-and-Stablecoin-Commitments-to-Advance-Solana-Treasury-Strategy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">extending</a> its innovative excellence to its capital strategy by building a balance sheet with SOL at its core.

Rather than generating revenue through product sales, the company now aims to create shareholder value through the active management of its SOL treasury.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The company's stated objective is to \"increase SOL-per-share\" for stockholders through on-chain activities like staking and DeFi participation, distinguishing itself from passive cryptocurrency holding strategies.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">“Solana has emerged as one of the most innovative and widely adopted blockchain ecosystems in the world. Our strategy to build an active Solana treasury program underscores our conviction in the long-term potential of SOL and our commitment to building shareholder value by directly participating in its growth.”&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: right;\">-&nbsp; Forward Industries’s CEO <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250907677362/en/Forward-Industries-Inc.-Announces-%241.65-Billion-Private-Placement-in-Cash-and-Stablecoin-Commitments-Led-by-Galaxy-Digital-Jump-Crypto-and-Multicoin-Capital-to-Initiate-Solana-Treasury-Strategy\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Puritt</a></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">New Leadership: The Significance of Kyle Samani</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Forward Industries appointed Kyle Samani, co-founder and Managing Partner of Multicoin Capital, as Chairman of the Board of Directors. Multicoin Capital is an influential crypto investment firm and early institutional backer of Solana.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The board was further strengthened with observers from other leading digital asset firms, including Chris Ferraro from Galaxy Digital and Saurabh Sharma from Jump Crypto. This leadership change signals the company's commitment to crypto-native expertise and institutional-grade digital asset management.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"forward-industries-sol-treasury-reserve-strategy\">Forward Industries' SOL Treasury Reserve Strategy</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As part of its SOL treasury strategy, Forward Industries plans to acquire a significant amount of SOL and explore opportunities through active management of its assets.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">6.822 Million SOL Holdings: The Initial Acquisition</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On September 15, 2025, Forward Industries announced acquiring 6,822,000 SOL at an average price of $232 per token, totaling approximately $1.58 billion—over 1.25% of SOL’s circulating supply. This acquisition was executed through a combination of open market purchases and on-chain transactions, including trades via <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-dex-aggregators-in-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">decentralized exchange aggregators</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This holding makes Forward Industries the world's largest corporate holder of Solana, positioning it as a significant player in the Solana ecosystem and institutional cryptocurrency adoption.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Active Alpha-Generation Mandate</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Forward Industries differentiates itself from passive cryptocurrency holders through its active management approach. The company <a href=\"http://businesswire.com/news/home/20250914533324/en/Forward-Industries-Now-Holds-More-Than-6.8-Million-SOL-Tokens-as-It-Commences-Solana-Treasury-Strategy%E2%80%A6\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">aims</a> to \"increase SOL-per-share through bespoke strategies and active management of the company's treasury.\"</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This strategy involves deploying SOL in various on-chain activities designed to generate additional returns beyond simple price appreciation, including staking rewards, lending protocols, and DeFi participation.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">100% Staking Strategy for On-Chain Yield</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Forward Industries has staked all of its acquired Solana tokens, demonstrating its commitment to active treasury management. Staking SOL generates rewards while contributing to network security, providing a foundational yield-generating strategy for the company's holdings.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This approach allows Forward Industries to earn <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-staking?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">staking</a> rewards on its entire SOL position while maintaining exposure to the token's price movements.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Strategic Partnership with Galaxy Asset Management</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To execute its on-chain strategy, Forward Industries entered into a services agreement with Galaxy Asset Management, a division of Galaxy Digital, one of its lead investors. By partnering with a dedicated asset management firm, Forward Industries&nbsp;ensures that treasury operations are managed by experienced institutional-grade asset managers with deep cryptocurrency expertise.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"how-forward-industries-acquires-solana\">How Forward Industries Acquires Solana</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Forward Industries' strategy is defined by two pillars: a massive initial acquisition of SOL and an active, on-chain management mandate designed to generate alpha and outperform a passive holding strategy.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The $1.65 Billion PIPE: Securing Foundational Capital</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Forward Industries secured its initial funding through a $1.65 billion Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) in early September 2025. The offering was led by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital, with these firms collectively subscribing for over $300 million.In return, the PIPE offering participants will receive the company’s common stock (or equivalent equity securities) at a negotiated discount to the market price at the time.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;The PIPE financing provided the foundational capital necessary to acquire Forward Industries' initial SOL treasury and establish its operations as a digital asset management company.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The $4 Billion ATM Offering: A Strategy for Continuous Growth</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Following the PIPE, Forward Industries filed for an At-The-Market (ATM) equity offering program of up to $4 billion. ATM offerings allow companies to sell shares into the market over time at prevailing prices, providing flexibility to raise capital when market conditions are favorable.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This structure enables Forward Industries to continuously expand its SOL holdings without being constrained by traditional financing timelines or market windows.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Execution via On-Chain and Open Market Purchases</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Forward Industries executes its SOL acquisitions through multiple channels, including traditional cryptocurrency exchanges and on-chain decentralized platforms. This multi-channel approach allows the company to optimize execution prices and minimize market impact when making large purchases.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The company has demonstrated its commitment to on-chain participation by acquiring SOL through decentralized exchange aggregator DFlow, illustrating its commitment to integration with the broader Solana DeFi ecosystem. This in turn lets it tap into different trading venues to receive the best execution for shareholders.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"benefits-of-holding-ford-stock\">Benefits of Holding FORD Stock</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Investing in Forward Industries (FORD) stock is a strategic choice to gain a specific type of exposure to the Solana ecosystem. The stock is best understood as a publicly-traded, actively managed, single-asset fund whose value is driven by its SOL holdings and its management's ability to grow SOL-per-share.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Leveraged, Actively Managed Exposure to Solana</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">FORD stock provides investors with exposure to Solana within a traditional equity wrapper on NASDAQ. This structure makes SOL exposure accessible to investors who may not directly hold cryptocurrencies due to regulatory, custodial, or technical constraints.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike passive SOL holding, FORD investors gain exposure to an actively managed strategy designed to outperform simple buy-and-hold approaches through on-chain yield generation and strategic treasury management.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Institutional-Grade Governance and Strategic Support</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Investment in FORD provides indirect access to the expertise of leading digital asset firms including Multicoin Capital, Galaxy Digital, and Jump Crypto. These firms offer strategic insights and operational advantages that individual investors typically cannot replicate.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The company's governance structure includes crypto-native leadership with deep Solana ecosystem knowledge, potentially providing informational and strategic advantages in digital asset management.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">A Catalyst for Institutional Solana Adoption</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Forward Industries represents both a product of and catalyst for increasing institutional adoption of Solana. Its successful capital raise and public listing provide a regulated entry point for institutional capital allocators seeking Solana exposure.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At time of writing, about 2.5% of the current supply of SOL is held by publicly-listed companies, with Forward Industries in the lead. The company's model may serve as a blueprint for other corporations considering digital asset treasury strategies, potentially driving broader institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"risks-and-criticisms-of-forward-industries-solana-treasury-strategy\">Risks and Criticisms of Forward Industries' Solana Treasury Strategy</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An investment in Forward Industries carries a unique set of risks. The company's value is almost entirely dependent on a single, highly volatile digital asset, and its strategy relies on continuous access to capital markets.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Extreme SOL Price Volatility and Single-Asset Concentration Risk</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Forward Industries faces significant exposure to Solana's price volatility, with the company's value directly correlated to SOL's market performance. Cryptocurrency markets are known for extreme price swings, which could result in substantial losses for shareholders.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The company's concentrated position in a single digital asset amplifies this risk, as adverse events specific to the Solana network could significantly impact Forward Industries' value without diversification benefits.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Active Management and Performance Risk</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Forward Industries' active management strategy introduces execution risk not present in passive holding approaches. On-chain strategies like DeFi participation could underperform expectations or result in losses, potentially reducing the overall treasury value.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The complexity of managing large-scale on-chain positions also introduces operational risks related to smart contract interactions, protocol changes, and market timing decisions.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Continuous Shareholder Dilution from Equity Fundraising</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The company's growth strategy relies on issuing new shares to fund additional SOL acquisitions, primarily through its $4 billion ATM offering. This process inherently dilutes existing shareholders' ownership percentages.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is no guarantee that the value created from newly acquired SOL will be sufficient to offset the dilutive effects of share issuance, potentially resulting in net value losses for existing shareholders.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">On-Chain Operational and Security Risks</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Deploying capital in DeFi protocols exposes Forward Industries' treasury to smart contract vulnerabilities, protocol exploits, and other on-chain security risks. These risks are inherent to decentralized finance and could result in permanent capital loss.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The company must also manage risks related to key management, transaction execution, and protocol governance changes that could affect its on-chain positions.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Reflexivity Risk Due to Scale</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With over 1.2% of the circulating supply of SOL in its custody, and as the largest corporate SOL holder, Forward Industries' trading activities could influence SOL's market price. Large-scale selling by the company could create downward pressure on SOL prices, potentially creating negative feedback loops that harm both the company and its shareholders.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This scale also makes Forward Industries a significant stakeholder in the Solana ecosystem, with potential governance implications and responsibilities that extend beyond simple asset management.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"future-impact\">Future Impact</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The transformation of Forward Industries is a pioneering experiment in the future of corporate finance, due to Forward Industries’ commitment to active yield generation beyond passive holding.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">A Blueprint for On-Chain Corporate Finance</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Forward Industries' transformation represents a pioneering experiment in corporate digital asset adoption. If successful, it could provide a template for other companies seeking to integrate cryptocurrencies into their treasury management strategies.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The company's approach demonstrates how traditional corporations can leverage public markets to access digital asset exposure while maintaining regulatory compliance and institutional-grade governance.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Pioneering the Tokenization of Corporate Operations</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Chairman Kyle Samani has outlined a long-term vision for Forward Industries to evolve into a \"$50 billion publicly traded permanent capital vehicle.\" This <a href=\"https://x.com/SolanaFloor/status/1967998749940359282\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">vision</a> includes potentially tokenizing the company's stock and migrating corporate functions like governance, dividends, and payroll directly on-chain.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such developments could create a truly transparent and digitally native public company, potentially influencing how corporations integrate blockchain technology into their core operations.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"final-thoughts\">Final Thoughts</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Forward Industries represents a unique case study in corporate transformation and institutional cryptocurrency adoption. While the company's radical pivot from manufacturing to digital asset management offers investors novel exposure to the Solana ecosystem, it also introduces significant risks related to cryptocurrency volatility, operational complexity, and market concentration.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The success or failure of Forward Industries' strategy will likely influence how other corporations approach digital asset integration and could shape the future relationship between traditional finance and decentralized financial infrastructure. Investors considering FORD stock should carefully evaluate both the potential benefits of institutional-grade Solana exposure and the substantial risks inherent in the company's concentrated, single-asset strategy.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Disclaimer: This article discusses Forward Industries’ SOL treasury strategy.

These developments signal that public companies are looking to leverage a higher-growth ecosystem since <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-solana-sol-and-how-does-it-work?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Solana</a> is known as a blockchain built for speed, scalability, and programmability. Companies that have adopted Solana treasuries aim to gain exposure to a growing dynamic crypto asset while differentiating themselves in the marketplace.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Accumulating SOL not only brings benefits from potential long-term price appreciation but also from staking yields. Since Solana operates on a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/proof-of-stake-pos\" target=\"_blank\">Proof-of-Stake</a> consensus mechanism, holders are able to earn yield by <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-staking\" target=\"_blank\">staking</a>, or locking up, their tokens to help secure the network. Companies are not only buying SOL but also staking it to earn additional rewards, while also strengthening the blockchain’s decentralization.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"how-companies-implement-solana-treasury-strategies\">How Companies Implement Solana Treasury Strategies</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The companies that have built Solana treasuries have not followed a single blueprint but are instead using different implementation methods that reflect a mixture of risk, return, and operational complexity.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Direct SOL Purchase and Staking</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most straightforward method is through direct token purchases followed by staking. In this model, companies raise capital or reallocate balance sheet cash to acquire SOL on the open market then commit those tokens to Solana’s network to generate yield.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It provides exposure to SOL’s potential price appreciation while also creating a recurring income stream from staking rewards which typically range from 6-8% annually. For example, Upexi is staking nearly all 2 million SOL in its holdings to earn an estimated $65,000 per day.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Validator Operations Model</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Companies can also implement Solana treasuries by operating or partnering with validator nodes in order to secure the network and earn staking rewards. Unlike simple token staking through third-party providers, this model provides more direct control over infrastructure and higher potential yield.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SOL Strategies, a Solana treasury company holding over 370,000 SOL,&nbsp;has scaled its validator operations significantly, with 3.6 million SOL under delegation from its own treasury and third-party wallets as of August 25, 2025. The company has also attracted over 7,000 unique wallets to its validator network, including institutional mandates such as ARK Invest’s Digital Asset Revolutions Fund.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Liquid Staking Integration</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-liquid-staking-liquid-staked-derivatives-you-need-to-know?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid staking</a> is the process of companies staking SOL to earn rewards while receiving <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/liquid-staking-tokens\" target=\"_blank\">Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs)</a> in return. These LSTs preserve <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/liquidity-crypto?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">liquidity</a> by allowing the staked position to be traded, borrowed against, or redeployed into other <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/yield-farming?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">yield</a> strategies. This model enhances capital efficiency since companies can compound rewards.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">DeFi Development was the first publicly traded company to adopt this approach with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dfdv-staked-sol\" target=\"_blank\">dfdvSOL</a> in partnership with Sanctum. The company is able to earn staking income while maintaining liquidity and creating a more flexible balance sheet structure.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Governance and Operational Framework</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Companies can implement Solana treasuries by establishing a clear governance and operational framework to manage holdings effectively. Some companies have started to formalize governance structures to emphasize how decisions are made, how performance is measured, and how risks are managed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, DeFi Development regularly publishes updates on its SOL Per Share (SPS) metric to align treasury growth with shareholder value. Meanwhile, SOL Strategies publishes financial statements that detail both treasury value and validator revenue. Upexi integrates this method by disclosing staking yields and net asset value (NAV) multiples to investors.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"top-publicly-traded-companies-holding-sol\">Top Publicly Traded Companies Holding SOL</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/treasuries/solana\" target=\"_blank\">top four publicly traded companies</a> with Solana treasuries hold almost 13 million SOL altogether in their treasuries as of mid September 2025.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Forward Industries (FORD): SOL Treasury Leader</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/treasuries/companies/forward-industries\" target=\"_blank\">Forward Industries</a> is a diversified company previously known for providing cases for medical and consumer electronics. Now, it has become the newest company to pivot to a Solana treasury alongside various strategies to create value within the ecosystem. While it might be the latest company to make this pivot, it has already cemented its position at the top of the list.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After completing its $1.65 billion private investment in public equity (PIPE) on September 11, 2025, the company wasted no time to purchase 6,822,000 SOL for a total cost of approximately $1.58 billion. The PIPE financing was led by investors Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital. Additionally, Kyle Samani from Multicoin Capital, Christopher Ferraro from Galaxy, and Saurabh Sharma from Jump Crypto hold positions on the Board of Directors of Forward Industries.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The company’s strategy is focused on acquiring SOL and deploying it via staking, lending, and other various DeFi activities to generate revenue that will then be used to acquire more SOL.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">DeFi Development Corp (DFDV): Liquid Staking and Validator Partnership</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/treasuries/companies/defi-dev\" target=\"_blank\">DeFi Development Corp. (DFDV)</a> has structured its Solana treasury around infrastructure integration and yield optimization. The company recently expanded its holdings to over 2 million SOL worth more than $511 million following SOL’s price of $244&nbsp;at time of writing The SOL accumulation was funded in part by a $125 million equity raise.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One distinguishing factor of DFDV is its adoption of liquid staking token (LST) technology through dfdvSOL, a liquid staking token developed in partnership with Sanctum. It is the first publicly traded company to incorporate Solana-based LSTs into its treasury, allowing it to compound staking rewards while preserving liquidity. The company has optimized a looped staking strategy to optimize its returns and earns approximately 12% in yield this way.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beyond staking, DFDV has also established a validator node collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bonk\" target=\"_blank\">Bonk</a> to deepen staking capacity as well as a strategic agreement with Solflare to become the official Solana wallet provider for DFDV’s initiatives. This structure transforms DFDV’s treasury into a hybrid of balance sheet exposure and ecosystem infrastructure play.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Upexi Inc (UPXI): SOL Treasury Leader</h3>\n<p>Another leader of Solana treasury adoption is <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/treasuries/companies/upexi\" target=\"_blank\">Upexi Inc. (UPXI)</a>, a Tampa-based consumer products company that has made one of the most aggressive corporate moves into Solana. It has built a treasury of more than 2 million SOL worth over $492 million following SOL’s $244 price at time of writing. The company began accumulating earlier in the year after announcing a $100 million raise dedicated to SOL purchases. Later on, this was expanded through a $200 million follow-up raise and a $500 million credit line.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After unveiling its Solana treasury strategy, Upexi’s share price surged more than 330%, signaling that investors see the company as a high-growth proxy for direct exposure to SOL.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Upexi stakes nearly all of its holdings and generates approximately 8% in yield, or about $65,000 a day in revenue. On top of that, about 57% of the company’s SOL was bought as locked tokens at a discount of around 15% compared to the market price, giving shareholders immediate built-in gains once those tokens unlock.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Sharps Technology (STSS): Institutional Partnerships</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Adding further momentum to Solana’s treasury adoption is <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/treasuries/companies/sharps-technology\" target=\"_blank\">Sharps Technology, Inc</a>. that recently unveiled one of the most ambitious strategies. Known as a medical device manufacturer, the company has pivoted part of its strategy into a Solana treasury. Heading the new treasury strategy are Alice Zhang as Chief Investment Officer and James Zhang as Strategic Advisor, both having deep ties to the Solana ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On August 25, 2025, Sharps announced it had secured over $400 million private placement backed by investors including ParaFi, Pantera, and FalconX. Then on September 2, 2025, it was announced that the funding was used to purchase more than 2 million SOL for long-term holding and staking income. Additionally, Sharps has signed a non-binding letter of intent with the Solana Foundations to secure the purchase of $50 million of SOL at a 15% discount to a 30-day time-weighted average price.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To further deepen its involvement in the Solana ecosystem, the company intends to stake a portion of its SOL to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bonk-staked-sol\" target=\"_blank\">BonkSOL</a>, BONK's liquid staking token (LST) product. Adding to that is a collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-pudgy-penguins-nfts\" target=\"_blank\">Pudgy Penguins</a> to jointly drive exposure and create new interaction opportunities for users.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"advantages-of-solana-treasuries\">Advantages of Solana Treasuries</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solana treasuries offer companies exposure to Solana’s fast-growing ecosystem where they can combine potential asset appreciation with additional income streams.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">High Staking Yields</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike Bitcoin, SOL can be staked to earn annual yields of around 6-8% which creates a predictable income stream. For companies, this turns a volatile asset into one that can also generate ongoing returns.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Upexi provides a clear example through its strategy of staking nearly all of its 2 million SOL treasury to earn around $65,000 per day or roughly $23-27 million annually. This income not only helps to offset SOL’s price volatility but also positions Solana treasuries as a more dynamic reserve strategy.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Growing Solana Ecosystem and Network Effects</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solana has established itself as a leading blockchain for high-throughput applications including <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/decentralized-finance-defi\" target=\"_blank\">decentralized finance</a> (DeFi), <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/non-fungible-tokens-nft\" target=\"_blank\">non-fungible tokens</a> (NFTs), and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/tokenized-products\" target=\"_blank\">tokenized assets</a>. The blockchain has seen meaningful growth in DeFi <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/total-value-locked?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Total Value Locked (TVL)</a> and earned its position among the top blockchains for on-chain liquidity and capital deployment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This enhances the utility of SOL treasuries since staked or held SOL can be more easily integrated into DeFi through lending, collateralization, or liquid staking. At the same time, Solana’s mature infrastructure helps to reduce friction treasury operations and allows companies to participate more actively in the network.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Operational Treasury Benefits</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A defining advantage of Solana treasuries lies in their operational benefits, which go beyond the passive nature of Bitcoin holdings. Whereas a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-corporate-bitcoin-treasuries?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin treasury</a> primarily depends on price appreciation, a Solana treasury can actively generate yield through staking, providing companies with a recurring revenue stream. This yield component effectively turns treasury reserves into a productive asset.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By running validator nodes, companies can capture additional revenues on top of staking rewards. This operational layer strengthens alignment with the Solana ecosystem and offers diversification beyond just potential token appreciation.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">LSTs such as dfdvSOL allow the company to stake SOL while keeping positions liquid, enabling them to redeploy capital or use staked assets as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-collateral-defi?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">collateral</a>. Companies can also retain the option to exit positions more easily by converting or trading LSTs, reducing liquidity risk. This provides flexibility and capital efficiency compared to traditional staking.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Smaller Market Cap With Higher Growth Potential</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another advantage to investing in Solana is that SOL still has a smaller market cap than Bitcoin and Ethereum which gives it more room to grow. While this makes it more volatile, it also means that new investment and adoption can have a bigger impact on its price. For companies, holding SOL is not just about having a reserve asset, it’s also a way to capture potential high-growth upside as Solana continues to expand its role in DeFi, NFTs, and tokenized assets.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"solana-vs-bitcoin-vs-ethereum-treasury-comparison\">Solana vs. Bitcoin vs. Ethereum Treasury Comparison</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are a few factors to consider when comparing Bitcoin, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/treasuries/ethereum\">Ethereum</a>, and Solana treasuries.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"challenges-facing-solana-treasuries\">Challenges Facing Solana Treasuries</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solana treasuries also bring challenges that companies need to manage ranging from high price volatility to operational risks from validator infrastructure.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Regulatory Uncertainty</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike Bitcoin, there is still no definitive U.S. regulatory classification for Solana. This creates legal and reporting risks that may affect how treasuries are valued or accounted for. It can also expose companies to enforcement actions if regulations tighten. Therefore a company should plan for enhanced legal review of securities-law exposure, conservative disclosure about risks, and flexible operational setups that can adapt if the regulatory posture changes.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Validator Slashing and Operational Risks</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Operating validators also adds a layer of risk and responsibility for companies managing Solana treasuries. The most direct risk comes from slashing penalties, which occur if a validator is found guilty of double-signing or other malicious activity. Although routine downtime on Solana typically results in lost rewards, misconfigured or compromised validators can still expose staked assets to penalties.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Beyond that, running validators requires 24/7 infrastructure maintenance since validator downtime translates quickly into missed rewards. This means treasury operators need specialized technical expertise in DevOps, security, and monitoring to ensure continuous uptime, manage software upgrades, and mitigate risks. This model also introduces significant hardware and operational costs which include high-performance servers, monitoring tools, and specialized personnel.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">FASB Fair Value Accounting Volatility</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2023-08, a new accounting standard for crypto assets that took effect in 2025. The rule requires public companies to measure qualifying crypto holdings at fair value with changes recognized in net income.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For treasury managers, this introduces several implications including quarterly earnings volatility since SOL’s price swings will flow directly through the income statement rather than being held at historical cost. During bull markets, this can inflate reported earnings, but in downturns, it can generate sharp paper losses that weigh on quarterly results. Even if long-term conviction in SOL remains, short-term market declines can compress reported net income, potentially unsettling investors unfamiliar with digital asset volatility.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It also adds more complex reporting requirements, as companies must track fair value adjustments each reporting period and provide expanded disclosures on valuation techniques and crypto-specific risks.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Market Volatility and Limited Risk Management Tools</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Another risk with Solana treasuries is their exposure to higher market volatility compared to Bitcoin. SOL remains more volatile due to its smaller market capitalization, faster growth profile, and sensitivity to network or ecosystem shocks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While Bitcoin benefits from deep institutional hedging markets, including Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) futures, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-spot-bitcoin-etf?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">spot ETFs</a>, and a wide range of structured products, Solana’s toolkit is still developing. CME launched Solana futures in March 2025, providing an initial step toward institutional adoption, but liquidity remains thin and usage is limited compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum contracts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Outside of CME, most SOL derivatives are concentrated on crypto-native exchanges with lower liquidity and limited regulatory oversight. Structured products such as covered calls or volatility hedges are also scarce, leaving companies with Solana treasuries more directly exposed to price swings and without the breadth of institutional-grade risk management options available for more established assets.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"how-to-invest-in-solana-sol-for-exposure\">How to Invest In Solana (SOL) for Exposure</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As investors, there are a few methods for mainstream investors to gain exposure to SOL.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Direct Stock Investment in SOL Treasury Companies</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the most straightforward ways is by investing directly in the public companies that hold large SOL reserves. Companies such as Forward Industries, Upexi, and DeFi Development&nbsp;have positioned themselves as publicly traded vehicles for Solana exposure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Buying shares in these companies gives investors indirect access to SOL price movements, staking yields, and treasury growth, but in a regulated equity format that can be held in traditional brokerage accounts.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">ETF and Fund Options</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As of mid-2025, there is no approved spot Solana ETF in the U.S., though proposals from VanEck, 21Shares, and Bitwise are pending. In contrast, Canada lists spot Solana ETFs with staking, such as 3iQ’s product on the Toronto Stock Exchange, while Europe offers Solana ETPs like the Bitwise Solana Staking ETP. Global crypto funds also provide SOL exposure within broader proof-of-stake baskets.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Risk Considerations for Retail Investors</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solana treasuries carry higher risks since SOL is more volatile than Bitcoin or Ethereum, institutional hedging tools are limited, and some treasury firms rely on capital raises that can dilute shareholders. Regulatory uncertainty over SOL’s classification adds further complexity, and equity exposure does not fully protect investors from the token’s volatility.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Portfolio Allocation Guidelines</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Due to its volatility and regulatory uncertainty, Solana is often viewed as a speculative, growth-oriented asset. In the context of treasuries, it is generally seen as a complement to more established holdings like Bitcoin or traditional investments, rather than a replacement.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The rise of Solana treasuries marks a new chapter in corporate adoption of digital assets, moving beyond Bitcoin’s passive reserves into more dynamic, yield-generating strategies. Companies like Upexi, DeFi Development Corp., SOL Strategies, and Sharps Technology have each carved out distinct approaches that demonstrate the versatility of Solana as a treasury asset.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The momentum is likely to continue since Forward Industries just launched its own Solana treasury strategy with&nbsp;a $1.65 billion PIPE, catapulting it to becoming the largest Solana treasury overnight. This indicates that we are still in the early stages of this trend and as Solana’s ecosystem continues to expand, it is likely that more publicly traded firms will follow.</p>\n<h3 class=\"tw-text-lg md:tw-text-2xl tw-font-bold tw-text-gray-900 dark:tw-text-white dark:tw-text-opacity-87\">\n  Related Articles\n</h3>"

It's no surprise that he takes the top position as he is not only one of the most vocal advocates but also runs the world's largest Bitcoin corporate treasury firm, holding over <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/treasuries/bitcoin\" target=\"_blank\">$73 billion</a> in Bitcoin at the time of writing.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Saylor's latest prediction is his most ambitious yet: $21 million per Bitcoin by 2046. \"<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-happens-last-bitcoin-mined\" target=\"_blank\">Twenty one million coins</a> at a $21 million price in 21 years,\" he declared at BTC Prague 2025, emphasizing the symbolic significance of the number 21 in Bitcoin's ecosystem. This figure also represents Bitcoin's maximum supply cap, making the prediction even more meaningful.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">His conviction runs deep. Strategy continues to aggressively <a href=\"https://www.strategy.com/purchases\">accumulate Bitcoin</a> even at all-time high prices throughout 2025, consistently raising their average purchase price. This unwavering commitment demonstrates Saylor's absolute faith in Bitcoin's long-term potential.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Most notable Bitcoin contribution: </strong>Creating the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin treasury, inspiring many others such as MetaPlanet to do the same.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" id=\"2-the-political-pioneer-nayib-bukele\">2. The Political Pioneer: Nayib Bukele</h2>\n<img src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/33967/content_nayib_bukele.webp\" alt=\"top bitcoin bull: nayib bukele\" />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Nayib Bukele, President of El Salvador, made history by making his country the first nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in September 2021 (officially recognized currency that must be accepted for payment of debts). At the time of writing, El Salvador holds <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/338387/el-salvador-scoops-21-btc-bitcoin-day-holdings-top-700m\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">6,313 BTC</a> worth approximately $701 million.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What makes Bukele unique among Bitcoin bulls isn't just his bullishness but his defiance to authority when it comes to Bitcoin. While the International Monetary Fund demanded El Salvador halt Bitcoin purchases as part of a <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/el-salvador-bukele-bitcoin-1b-prediction-markets-kalshi-polymarket\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$1.4 billion loan agreement</a> in 2024, Bukele quietly continued accumulating. His central bank president and finance minister publicly claimed purchases had stopped to satisfy the IMF, but Bukele and the Bitcoin Office kept announcing new acquisitions, creating a deliberate contradiction that shows where his true loyalties lie.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This institutional resistance makes his Bitcoin conviction even more remarkable. Few leaders would risk a crucial IMF bailout for a volatile cryptocurrency, yet Bukele continues his <a href=\"https://cointelegraph.com/news/el-salvador-president-bukele-bitcoin-buying-to-continue-imf-deal\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">\"one Bitcoin per day\"</a> policy despite international pressure.

Her investment firm explored and researched Bitcoin’s potential as an emerging asset back when it was just $250 in 2015.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most importantly, ARK Invest, under Cathie Wood's leadership, was among the earliest and most persistent advocates for Bitcoin ETF approval in the United States. Their efforts significantly contributed to the eventual approval process.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ARK partnered with 21Shares and filed their first Bitcoin ETF application in 2021, making them one of the earliest applicants. This initial application was rejected, but ARK persisted with multiple amendments to their application through 2023. Bitcoin ETFs were eventually approved in 2024 and it can be said that Wood’s persistent efforts through ARK Invest were pivotal in this success.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">ARK Invest continues to advocate and conduct research into Bitcoin as an investment asset, their <a href=\"https://www.ark-invest.com/articles/valuation-models/arks-bitcoin-price-target-2030\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">latest report</a> at the time of writing predicts a bear case of $300,000 by 2030 and a bull case of $1.5 million by 2030.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Most notable Bitcoin contribution: </strong>Pivotal early advocate whose persistent Bitcoin ETF applications starting in 2021 helped advance the eventual US approval process.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" id=\"4-the-macro-strategist-arthur-hayes\">4.

He continues to advocate for Bitcoin in 2025, predicting Bitcoin will hit <a href=\"https://decrypt.co/323135/money-printing-lift-bitcoin-250k-this-year-arthur-hayes\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$250,000</a> by the end of 2025 if the Federal Reserve returns to quantitative easing, with a longer-term target of $1 million by <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/352482/arthur-hayes-repeats-1-million-bitcoin-price-prediction-by-2028\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2028</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">His analysis focuses on macroeconomic liquidity cycles (periods when central banks inject money into the economy). For instance, <a href=\"https://bitbo.io/news/fed-liquidity-bitcoin-q1-2025/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hayes predicted</a> Bitcoin would benefit from $612 billion in US Treasury spending and Federal Reserve policy changes in early 2025, driving the crypto market to new highs before a potential correction.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Hayes is like a macroeconomic detective, connecting global monetary policies to Bitcoin's price movements. His background at Deutsche Bank and experience in traditional finance gives him unique insight into how central bank actions drive capital flows into alternative assets like Bitcoin.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Most notable Bitcoin contribution: </strong>Pioneering macroeconomic analysis that connects central bank policies to Bitcoin price movements, educating traders on liquidity cycles.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" id=\"5-the-bitcoin-payment-architect-jack-dorsey\">5. The Bitcoin Payment Architect: Jack Dorsey</h2>\n<img src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/33970/content_jack_dorsey.webp\" alt=\"top bitcoin bull: jack dorsey\" />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter (now X) and CEO of Block (formerly Square), has positioned himself as Bitcoin's most prominent Silicon Valley champion. His vision of Bitcoin as \"the native currency of the internet\" has driven massive corporate adoption through his companies.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dorsey's prediction is bold yet measured: \"At least a million\" dollars per Bitcoin <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-dorsey-predicts-bitcoin-hit-182715304.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">by 2030</a>, with potential to go even higher. His conviction runs deep—Block holds <a href=\"https://bitcointreasuries.net/public-companies/block\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">8,692 BTC</a> and has built an entire ecosystem around Bitcoin, including the Bitkey hardware wallet, Bitcoin mining operations, and Square's merchant payment systems.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What sets Dorsey apart is his focus on utility over speculation. Block is rolling out Bitcoin payments across its Square terminals to over 4 million merchants, with full deployment expected <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/07/23/square-begins-rollout-of-bitcoin-payments-for-sellers-targets-full-availability-by-2026\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">by 2026</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Dorsey's approach is like building the infrastructure for a new economy rather than just betting on price appreciation. He's creating the pipes and payment rails that could make Bitcoin function as everyday money. “We want Bitcoin to become p2p electronic cash and everyday money, as it was designed to be,” he recently <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-dorsey-advocates-bitcoin-everyday-113113106.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">stated</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Most notable Bitcoin contribution: </strong>Building Bitcoin payment infrastructure through Block, enabling millions of merchants to accept Bitcoin as everyday money.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" id=\"6-the-original-bitcoin-evangelist-roger-ver\">6.

He earned this nickname by evangelizing Bitcoin when most people had never heard of cryptocurrency, investing in Bitcoin startups, and helping build the ecosystem from the ground up.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, Ver's story is complicated. He later became a champion of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a fork of Bitcoin that aimed to solve scaling issues through larger block sizes. Ver also <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/15/why-bitcoin-jesus-is-so-bullish-about-bitcoin-cash.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> “I’m incredibly bullish on Bitcoin Cash for the exact same reasons I was bullish on Bitcoin back in 2011.” This split the Bitcoin community and created lasting controversy.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite the Bitcoin Cash divergence, Ver's early contributions to Bitcoin adoption can't be overstated. He funded dozens of Bitcoin startups, promoted Bitcoin acceptance among merchants, and helped establish the foundation for today's cryptocurrency ecosystem. Think of him as the person who planted the seeds for Bitcoin's growth, even if he later decided to tend a different garden.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Most notable Bitcoin contribution: </strong>Early Bitcoin evangelist who funded dozens of startups and established foundational infrastructure when Bitcoin was unknown.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" id=\"7-the-macro-educator-raoul-pal\">7.

Unlike other analysts who focus on technical predictions, Pal's strength lies in translating complex Bitcoin concepts for institutional audiences who speak the language of traditional markets.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pal's approach centers on narrative building rather than precise price targets. His \"Everything Code\" thesis and \"Great Debasement\" framework have become foundational concepts that many Bitcoin advocates now use to explain cryptocurrency's value proposition. He popularized the idea that we're entering a new monetary era where scarce digital assets will outperform everything else.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through Real Vision's platform, Pal has interviewed hundreds of Bitcoin experts, creating an educational ecosystem that bridges Wall Street and crypto. His content has influenced countless traditional investors to allocate to Bitcoin, making him more of a thought leader than a predictor.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Most notable Bitcoin contribution: </strong>Developed \"The Everything Code\" and \"Great Debasement\" frameworks that became foundational concepts for institutional Bitcoin adoption arguments.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" id=\"8-the-bestselling-bitcoin-bull-robert-kiyosaki\">8.

His \"fake money\" philosophy resonated with millions of investors skeptical of traditional markets. But Bitcoin changed everything for the financial educator who typically distrusts new financial instruments.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Kiyosaki now lumps Bitcoin together with his beloved precious metals, calling them the ultimate protection against what he predicts will be the \"Greatest Depression.\" His message resonates particularly well with gold bugs (investors who prefer physical precious metals) and real estate investors who already distrusted the financial system—he simply added Bitcoin to their anti-establishment portfolio.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Kiyosaki's Bitcoin price prediction is similar to previous advocates we have mentioned, he thinks Bitcoin will reach $1 million <a href=\"https://x.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1935436340348567938\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">by 2030</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Most notable Bitcoin contribution: </strong>Bringing Bitcoin to mainstream audiences, and advocating for Bitcoin to be included alongside gold and real estate as protective assets against inflation.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" id=\"9-the-network-strategist-anthony-pompliano\">9.

He translates complex Bitcoin concepts into digestible content for mainstream audiences, helping bridge the gap between cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traditional investors.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pompliano consistently advocates for Bitcoin as a store of value (an asset that maintains its worth over time) and hedge against inflation. His approach focuses on Bitcoin's network effects (the idea that Bitcoin becomes more valuable as more people use it) and its role in portfolio diversification.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">His daily newsletter and podcast have educated millions about Bitcoin, making him one of the most influential voices in cryptocurrency education. Think of him as Bitcoin's translator, taking complex technical and economic concepts and making them accessible to everyone.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Most notable Bitcoin contribution: </strong>Creating \"The Pomp Podcast,\" one of crypto's most influential shows that brought Bitcoin education to millions of mainstream listeners.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\" id=\"10-the-unpredictable-bitcoiner-elon-musk\">10. The Unpredictable Bitcoiner: Elon Musk</h2>\n<img src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/33975/content_elon_musk.webp\" alt=\"top bitcoin bull: elon musk\" />\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has maintained a complex relationship with Bitcoin. His influence on cryptocurrency markets is undeniable, a single tweet from Musk can move markets by billions of dollars, making him one of crypto's most powerful voices.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Musk's most dramatic crypto saga involved Bitcoin. In early 2021, Tesla announced it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin and would accept it as payment for vehicles. This sent Bitcoin soaring to new heights. However, just months later, Musk reversed course, citing environmental concerns about Bitcoin's energy consumption from mining operations. Tesla suspended Bitcoin payments, causing the cryptocurrency to plummet.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Despite his turbulent relationship with Bitcoin, Musk recently praised Bitcoin on social media, calling fiat money \"<a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1942028633670848810\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hopeless\"</a> and positioning Bitcoin as central to his America Party's fiscal vision. Regardless of his antics, actions speak louder than words, his companies continue to hold massive amounts of Bitcoin despite his public misgivings on the cryptocurrency, with <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/366874/spacex-bitcoin-holdings-exceed-1-billion\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SpaceX</a> and <a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-bitcoin-holdings-now-worth-203200899.html?guccounter=1\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tesla</a> holding over $2.1 billion worth of Bitcoin combined, showing his long term commitment to Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Controversies around his Bitcoin and other crypto endeavors remain numerous but his influence and support for Bitcoin at times, is undeniable, making him a worthy inclusion on this list.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Most notable Bitcoin contribution:</strong> One of the earliest and largest corporate adoptions of Bitcoin, with Tesla's $1.5 billion purchase inspiring other Fortune 500 companies to follow suit.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These ten Bitcoin bulls represent different perspectives on why the world's first cryptocurrency will continue to appreciate in value. From corporate treasuries to national reserves, from Wall Street hedge funds to venture capital firms, their collective influence has helped transform Bitcoin from a fringe digital experiment into a recognized asset class.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While their predictions range from conservative ($300,000) to extraordinary ($21 million), these influential figures share a common belief that Bitcoin's best days lie ahead. Their combined influence, capital allocation, and public advocacy continue to drive institutional adoption and mainstream acceptance.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Whether their bold predictions prove accurate remains to be seen, but their impact on Bitcoin's journey is undeniable. As traditional monetary systems face increasing pressure and digital assets gain legitimacy, these Bitcoin bulls may prove to be visionaries who recognized the future of money before the rest of the world caught on.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>This article is for educational purposes only and is not financial advice.

SHA-256 is a cryptographic hashing function that protects transaction records and makes them tamper-proof (immutable).&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin uses SHA-256 to secure every block in the blockchain and power its mining process. This same algorithm also serves as the security backbone for services you use daily—from Amazon Web Services securing your online shopping, to Google Chrome protecting your web browsing, to the Apple App Store verifying every app download.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is the cryptographic foundation that secures the Bitcoin network, making transactions tamper-proof.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">SHA-256 secures not just the Bitcoin network but also everyday IT services such as Amazon Web Services and app store downloads.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Breaking SHA-256 through brute force would theoretically take longer than the age of the universe, even if every computer on earth combined their efforts.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Quantum computers could theoretically reduce cracking time, but would ultimately still be unable to feasibly crack SHA-256.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/33899/content_sha-256_cover.webp\" alt=\"sha-256 cover\" />\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"what-is-cryptographic-hashing\">What Is Cryptographic Hashing</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At its core, cryptographic hash functions are mathematical algorithms that transform any input (text, numbers, or data) into a fixed-length string of characters. SHA-256 specifically transforms any input—whether it's a single letter, an entire book, or a massive database—into exactly 64 characters (representing 256 bits of data). The security feature of hashing functions is that it is easy to compute one way (hashing your data), but mathematically infeasible to compute in the reverse order (deriving your data from the hashed 64 characters).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here's a simple math analogy: Let's say you start with the number 7. Now perform these operations in order: multiply by 13, add 29, multiply by 8, subtract 15, then multiply by 47. You get 12,561 as your final answer. Going forward (Computing 7 into 12,561) is easy if you know the steps. But if someone only gave you the final number 12,561 and asked you to find the original number, you'd have to try millions of different combinations to work backwards—and that's with just 5 simple steps! SHA-256 uses 64 rounds of incredibly complex mathematical operations involving bitwise rotations, additions, and logical functions. Even with the world's most powerful computers working together, reversing SHA-256 would take longer than the age of the universe.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Key Properties of Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA-256)</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Deterministic: The algorithm always gives you the same output for the same input. Type \"Hello World\" and you'll always get the same hash.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fixed Output Length: Regardless of whether you input a single letter or an entire encyclopedia, the output is always exactly 256 bits (64 characters when displayed).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One-Way Function: You can easily go from input to hash, but it's virtually impossible to go backwards from hash to input. It's like trying to unscramble an egg.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Avalanche Effect: Change even one tiny bit of the input (like adding a single comma), and the entire output changes dramatically. If you modify the data with small things, like a single space or a comma, it will completely change the hash output.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Collision Resistance: It's virtually impossible for two different pieces of input data to generate the same hash, ensuring integrity and security in critical applications.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Try it out yourself! Key in anything you want and hash it at <a href=\"https://tools.keycdn.com/sha256-online-generator\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://tools.keycdn.com/sha256-online-generator</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/33898/content_image1.webp\" alt=\"sha-256 generator\" />\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"the-history-of-sha-256\">The History of SHA-256</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SHA-256, a cornerstone of modern cryptography, emerged from the U.S. National Security Agency's (NSA) efforts to strengthen cryptographic hash functions in the early 2000s. Published in 2001 as part of the SHA-2 family, it was designed to address growing concerns about the security of its predecessor, SHA-1.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Its adoption accelerated dramatically with the rise of Bitcoin in 2009, where SHA-256 became integral to the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/proof-of-work-pow\" target=\"_blank\">proof-of-work</a> consensus mechanism. Today, it remains one of the most widely deployed cryptographic hash functions, securing everything from digital certificates and password storage to blockchain networks and secure communications protocols.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How SHA-256 Works (The Simple Version)</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Think of SHA-256 as an incredibly sophisticated blender:</p>\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Input Processing: It takes your data and chops it into standardized chunks of 512 bits each</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Mathematical Mixing: It performs 64 rounds of complex mathematical operations on each chunk</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Final Output: After all the mixing, it produces exactly 256 bits of completely scrambled data</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Real-World Example</h3>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Input: \"CoinGecko\"</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SHA-256 Output: ffcc5032ff84bc2dde5818a7c466243c10ee6f24e3333b81d80d93b0df7b1f7b</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Input: \"CoinGecko!!\" (just added an exclamation mark)</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SHA-256 Output: 8548ee03082e4945185015704b6bc6f0dc073030683ba924378aa07ead058dda</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Notice how adding just one character completely changed the output! This is an important feature as it makes evidence of data tampering more apparent. An attacker cannot simply hide their tracks now by just changing a small bit of the data as it results in a completely different output.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"how-sha-256-is-used-in-the-bitcoin-network\">How SHA-256 Is Used in the Bitcoin Network</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin doesn't just use SHA-256 once—it actually uses double SHA-256 for extra security. If you're hashing something in Bitcoin, you're almost always using HASH256. This works by putting the data through SHA-256, then taking the result and putting it through SHA-256 again. Documentations however, show that double SHA-256 is not necessary but was implemented by the creator of Bitcoin, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto\" target=\"_blank\">Satoshi Nakamoto</a>, presumably as a safety precaution.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Two Critical Uses in Bitcoin</h3>\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Mining and Proof of Work</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Miners compete to find a nonce (a special number) that, when combined with a block of Bitcoin’s data (the data input) and hashed using SHA-256, produces a hash (output) that meets Bitcoin's difficulty requirement. Think of it like a digital lottery—miners have a block of Bitcoin transaction data, and they add a special number (the nonce) to it, they keep trying different nonces, until they find a “winning” hash (the output) that starts with many zeroes. The number of zeroes required depends on the Bitcoin mining difficulty level, which adjusts every 2 weeks to keep block creation steady at roughly 1 block every 10 minutes.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SHA-256 proves that a miner who has successfully found the winning nonce did so through pure hard work (proof of work!), as finding a resulting hash that meets the requirements in any other way is <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/can-you-mine-bitcoin-solo\" target=\"_blank\">unlikely</a>.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Immutability</p>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each Bitcoin block contains the SHA-256 hash of the previous block, creating a link between blocks, a blockchain, if you will. If someone tries to alter a past transaction, it would change that block's hash, but also cause each successive block to have mismatching hashes. This mismatch of block hashes invalidates the whole chain of blockchain data, which amplifies the evidence of data tampering in that set of blockchain data.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"what-it-takes-to-crack-sha-256\">What It Takes to Crack SHA-256</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ever wondered why Bitcoin's popular tagline is \"vires in numeris?\" That's Latin for \"strength in numbers,\" because as you're about to see, the numbers required to crack Bitcoin's cryptographic foundation are truly astronomical. Let's explore a hypothetical situation of what it would take to crack SHA-256.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Brute Force Approach</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To crack SHA-256 through brute force (trying every possible combination), an attacker would need to try up to 2^256 different possibilities. To put this number in perspective:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">2^256 = 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,853,269,984,665,640,564,039,457,584,007,913,129,639,936.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">This number has 78 digits.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Now, assume you have a giga galactic super computer (watch this fun <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9JGmA5_unY\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> to learn all about that hypothetical!), that has the computational power of a thousand Googles. If everyone on earth had this computer and combined their efforts at breaking SHA-256, it would still take over 507 billion years to have a chance at finding the correct guess.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Current Bitcoin Network's Power</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To understand the scale, consider that the current Bitcoin hashrate as of writing is 977.29 EH/s, representing the global Bitcoin network hashrate. This means the network performs nearly a quintillion (1,000,000,000,000,000,000) hash calculations every second.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If we could somehow redirect this entire network to crack a single SHA-256 hash instead of mining, it would still take far longer than the age of the universe to succeed through brute force.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Quantum Computing Wild Card</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Quantum computers represent the most realistic threat to SHA-256, but even here, the numbers are reassuring for Bitcoin holders.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Grover's Algorithm Effect: A quantum computer using Grover's algorithm could potentially reduce the complexity of cracking SHA-256 from 2^256 (theoretically secure against brute force attacks on classical computers) to 2^128 operations, which is still formidable but significantly less secure.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Current Reality: Even using Grover's algorithm, it is currently believed to be essentially impossible to break a hash function like SHA256 according to a study by the <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/25196/chapter/6\">National Academies Press</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even if you disregard current assurances against the threat of quantum computing, the Bitcoin community has been aware of potential quantum threats since at least 2010, with ongoing research into post-quantum cryptography and migration strategies that could be implemented via a soft fork when needed.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Energy Requirements: The Ultimate Barrier</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Even if someone built a super computer capable of trying every combination, the energy requirements would be astronomical. Breaking SHA-256 through brute force would require more energy than is available on Earth, making it not just computationally impossible, but physically impossible as well.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"beyond-bitcoin-other-uses-of-sha-256\">Beyond Bitcoin: Other Uses of SHA-256</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SHA-256's security has made it ubiquitous in the digital world:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Web Security: SHA-256 is used for authenticating Debian software packages and in the DKIM message signing standard; SHA-512 (also part of the SHA-2 standard) is part of a system to authenticate archival video from the International Criminal Tribunal of the Rwandan genocide.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Government Applications: SHA-1 and SHA-2 are the Secure Hash Algorithms required by law for use in certain U.S. Government applications, including use within other cryptographic algorithms and protocols, for the protection of sensitive unclassified information.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Digital Certificates: SHA-256 helps secure digital certificates used in HTTPS websites and secure communication protocols like TLS/SSL and SSH, where it verifies data integrity and authenticates certificates. It's also widely used throughout Unix/Linux systems for verifying file integrity, software packages, and system security.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"conclusion-the-digital-fort-knox\">Conclusion: The Digital Fort Knox</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin's security through SHA-256 represents one of the most robust cryptographic implementations in human history. The combination of mathematical impossibility (brute force cracking) and physical impossibility (energy requirements) creates a fortress that has withstood over 15 years of attacks from hackers, and critics.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The beauty of SHA-256 lies not just in its mathematical elegance, but in its practical application within Bitcoin's ecosystem. Every transaction, every block, and every security guarantee depends on this 20-year-old algorithm that continues to prove its worth day after day.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While quantum computing represents a theoretical future challenge, the timeline for practical quantum attacks on SHA-256 extends decades into the future, giving the cryptographic community ample time to prepare post-quantum alternatives if needed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For now, Bitcoin users can rest assured that their digital assets are protected by some of the strongest cryptographic techniques known to humanity, a mathematical function that would take longer to crack than the universe has existed.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This article is for educational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice. Cryptocurrency investments carry inherent risks, and past performance does not guarantee future results. Always conduct your own research and consider consulting with a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"frequently-asked-questions\">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n<ol>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Can SHA-256 be broken?&nbsp;</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No, SHA-256 cannot be broken with current technologies. Breaking it through brute force would require trying 2^256 combinations, a number so large that even if every computer on Earth worked together, it would take over 507 billion years to crack.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">What happens if SHA-256 is compromised?</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If SHA-256 were ever compromised, Bitcoin could implement a new cryptographic algorithm through a soft fork. The Bitcoin community has been preparing for this possibility since 2010, with ongoing research into post-quantum cryptography.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Why does Bitcoin use SHA-256 twice?&nbsp;</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Bitcoin uses double SHA-256 (running the algorithm twice) as an extra security precaution implemented by Satoshi Nakamoto. While cryptographers agree this isn't strictly necessary as single SHA-256 is already secure, the double hashing provides additional protection against certain theoretical attacks and was likely added as a conservative safety measure.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Is SHA-256 better than SHA-512?</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SHA-256 isn't necessarily \"better\" than SHA-512, they serve different purposes. Bitcoin chose SHA-256 because it provides sufficient security (256 bits) while being more efficient in terms of computational resources and storage space. SHA-512's longer output (512 bits) would double the storage requirements without meaningfully improving Bitcoin's security.</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">How long does it take to calculate SHA-256?</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Calculating a single SHA-256 hash takes mere microseconds on modern hardware. A typical computer can perform millions of SHA-256 calculations per second. This speed is what makes SHA-256 practical for Bitcoin mining, where miners perform quintillions of hashes per second globally yet the one-way nature means reversing even one hash would take longer than the age of the universe.</p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Do all cryptocurrencies use SHA-256?&nbsp;</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No, different cryptocurrencies use different hashing algorithms. While Bitcoin uses SHA-256, Ethereum uses Keccak-256 (a variant of SHA-3), Litecoin uses Scrypt, and Monero uses RandomX. Each algorithm has different properties regarding mining hardware requirements, energy efficiency, and resistance to specialized mining equipment (ASICs).</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<h3 dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\">Can I mine Bitcoin without SHA-256?&nbsp;</h3>\n\t</li>\n</ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No, mining Bitcoin specifically requires SHA-256 calculations. The entire Bitcoin protocol is built around this algorithm, from mining new blocks to linking blocks in the blockchain. Using a different algorithm would create an entirely different cryptocurrency that wouldn't be compatible with the Bitcoin network. SHA-256 is fundamental to Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus mechanism.</p>\n<h3 class=\"tw-text-lg md:tw-text-2xl tw-font-bold tw-text-gray-900 dark:tw-text-white dark:tw-text-opacity-87\">\n  Related Articles\n</h3>"

This emerging market processed over $124.5 million in trading volume during August 2025 alone, marking a 5.5-fold increase from early 2025, while addressing longstanding challenges in traditional collectibles trading.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The tokenization of Pokémon cards operates within the broader $21.4 billion trading cards market, offering solutions to issues including authentication challenges, shipping risks, geographical limitations, and liquidity constraints that have historically hindered the efficient trading of physical collectibles.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"understanding-tokenized-trading-cards\">Understanding Tokenized Trading Cards</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tokenized Pokémon cards are blockchain-based digital representations of authenticated physical Pokémon trading cards stored in secure, third-party vaults. Unlike purely digital <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft\" target=\"_blank\">NFTs</a>, these tokens maintain a verifiable 1:1 relationship with physical cards, enabling global trading without the risks associated with physical shipment while preserving the option for holders to redeem the actual cards.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The tokenization process transforms traditional card collecting into a hybrid model that combines digital efficiency with physical asset backing, where the corresponding NFT contains comprehensive metadata about the specific card.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"key-benefits-of-tokenized-pokemon-cards\">Key Benefits of Tokenized Pokémon Cards</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tokenized Pokémon cards offer several advantages over traditional physical card trading by leveraging blockchain technology and secure custody solutions:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Instant Global Trading</strong>: Digital transactions complete within seconds, compared to traditional sales requiring days or weeks for physical delivery. There are no geographic barriers as collectors worldwide can participate without shipping restrictions or regional availability constraints.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Enhanced Security and Authentication</strong>: Professional grading services like PSA, BGS, and SGC establish condition and authenticity before tokenization, while blockchain verification and secure vault storage eliminate concerns about counterfeit cards that plague secondary markets.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Transparent Price Discovery</strong>: Real-time market data and complete transaction history provide clear pricing mechanisms that may be absent in fragmented physical markets. Users can access comprehensive metadata on the platform, including condition details, rarity information, and provenance records.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Improved Liquidity Options</strong>: Platforms offer instant buyback features (typically 85-90% of market value) providing immediate exit opportunities for cards attained through gacha/”pack opening.” High-value cards can be divided into fractional ownership shares, democratizing access to premium collectibles that might otherwise be unaffordable.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Lower Transaction Costs</strong>: On-chain marketplaces typically charge 2-4% (including redemption fees) compared to traditional trading card marketplaces such as eBay, which charges 13.25% of the total sale price (up to $7,500).</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Interoperability</strong>: Standard NFT formats enable trading across multiple marketplaces and platforms, enhancing overall market liquidity and providing more trading venues for collectors.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"understanding-the-rwa-context-and-market-dynamics\">Understanding the RWA Context and Market Dynamics</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tokenized Pokémon cards represent a specific application within the real world assets (RWA) space, where physical assets gain digital representations on blockchain networks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The collectibles segment has emerged as a distinct RWA category, alongside more established areas like tokenized <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/real-world-assets-tokenized-us-treasuries?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">treasuries</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-tokenized-stocks?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">stocks</a>. In particular, Pokémon cards specifically benefit from certain characteristics that make them suitable for tokenization:</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Established Valuation Systems</strong>: Professional grading services like PSA and BGS provide standardized condition assessment and pricing benchmarks, creating transparent value references that support digital trading. Users can enter the grading ID to check the card in the grading service’s database like <a href=\"https://www.psacard.com/cert\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.psacard.com/cert</a>, which also offers more details around the card, including an estimated market value.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>High Transaction Friction</strong>: Traditional Pokémon card trading may involve challenges like shipping delays, authentication concerns, and geographic limitations, which blockchain solutions can address through instant settlement and verified provenance.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Nostalgic Demand</strong>: The millennial demographic driving crypto adoption also represents the primary market for Pokémon card collecting, creating natural user overlap between traditional collectors and blockchain-native traders.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Liquidity Constraints</strong>: Physical card markets may suffer from limited buyer pools and slow price discovery, particularly for more common cards. Meanwhile, tokenization of high-value items&nbsp;can unlock liquidity through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/fractional-nfts?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">fractional ownership</a>,, inviting broader participation.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"the-tokenization-process-from-physical-to-digital\">The Tokenization Process: From Physical to Digital</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The transformation of physical Pokémon cards into tradeable digital assets generally follows a process designed to ensure security, authenticity, and regulatory compliance.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Authentication and Vaulting</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A collector first sends their physical cards to a secure, third-party vaulting partner. Before submission, cards must have received professional grading from recognized authentication services, which establishes their condition and authenticity. Leading platforms partner with established security providers—Courtyard works with Brink's security services while Collector Crypt utilizes PWCC vault facilities—ensuring institutional-grade custody standards.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Upon arrival at secure facilities, each card undergoes comprehensive documentation including high-resolution photography, detailed condition assessments, and assignment of unique identification numbers. These physical cards are then stored in climate-controlled environments with full insurance coverage, addressing traditional concerns about card preservation and security.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Digital Minting and Smart Contract Implementation</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The digital representation emerges through smart contract deployment, typically utilizing ERC-721 NFT standards containing metadata linking to specific physical cards. This metadata includes grading information, serial numbers, storage locations, and complete provenance history. This NFT acts as a digital certificate of ownership, or a \"digital IOU,\" cryptographically tied to the specific physical card held in storage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Platforms implement real-time verification systems to ensure 1:1 backing between tokens and physical assets. Critical ownership and transaction data remains on-chain for permanence, while supplementary information like detailed imagery may utilize IPFS decentralized storage for cost efficiency.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Redemption Mechanisms</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The system's value is anchored by the promise of redeemability, which is automated by <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-smart-contracts?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">smart contracts</a>. The owner of the NFT can, at any time, choose to \"<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/token-burn?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\">burn</a>\" the token through the platform's interface. This action permanently removes the NFT from circulation and signals the vault to prepare the physical card for shipment back to the owner.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The user typically pays a withdrawal fee plus shipping costs to complete the process. This physical-digital-physical loop ensures every token is backed by a tangible asset, though it introduces a critical risk: the entire system's integrity rests on the trust placed in the centralized vaulting partner.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"on-chain-marketplaces-recreating-the-pack-opening-experience\">On-Chain Marketplaces: Recreating the Pack-Opening Experience</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Once minted, these card-backed NFTs can be traded on specialized on-chain marketplaces that offer significant advantages over Web2 platforms like eBay, including lower fees, instant settlement, and interoperability with larger NFT ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the most explosive growth has been driven by gamified features that replicate the thrill of opening a fresh pack of cards, as seen from the popularity of Courtyard, Collector Crypt, Phygitals, and RIP.FUN.</p>\n<img src=\"https://assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/33914/content_Tokenized_Pokemon_TCG_performance.webp\" alt=\"Tokenized Pokemon TCG performance\" />\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Collector Crypt's Gacha Feature</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A leading example on the Solana blockchain is Collector Crypt, whose most popular product is its \"Gacha Machine\". This feature allows users to buy randomized NFT packs using crypto, digitally recreating the ritual of opening booster packs. A key innovation is an instant buyback feature, which gives users the option to immediately sell their revealed NFT back to the platform, providing instant liquidity. The platform's ecosystem is powered by its native utility token, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/collector-crypt\" target=\"_blank\">CARDS</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Courtyard.io's Digital Packs</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Operating on the Polygon network, Courtyard.io has seen tremendous success with a similar model centered on \"digital pack\" drops from its \"Vending Machine\". The platform drives liquidity through these gamified pack-ripping experiences, which also include an instant buyback mechanic, typically offering 90% of the card's fair market value.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Courtyard also focuses on security, partnering with global leader Brink's for vaulting services, and differentiates itself with a zero-fee marketplace for vaulted items.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Phygitals: The Emerging Challenger</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Also operating on Solana, Phygitals leans heavily into a \"phygital\" (physical + digital) hybrid model. Like the others, the platform's core experience involves users opening digital packs to instantly reveal a real, physical Pokémon card. From there, collectors have the choice to hold the card digitally, trade it, redeem the physical version, or sell it back to the platform for 85% of its market value—a feature that provides immediate liquidity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Phygitals also has a strong emphasis on gamification, offering interactive games like a \"Claw Machine\" and \"Lucky Draw\" for users to win cards.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">RIP.FUN: Buy and Open New Packs</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Unlike the above three platforms, which repackage opened cards, RIP.FUN lets users buy and open new packs and trade or sell the cards pulled. All transactions, pulls, and ownership details are recorded on Base.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When users open a pack on RIP.FUN, they are opening a real physical pack, and the cards pulled are exactly what came out of the pack, which they can keep digitally or redeem physically. The entire unboxing process of opening a new physical pack is stored on video, so users can watch footage of the pack being opened to confirm authenticity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Currently, Rip.Fun is in closed beta. Opening packs, trading cards, and actively participating on the platform will earn users EXP points, which can be redeemed for in-platform rewards such as mystery packs, special collectibles, or additional cards.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"considerations-and-risks-around-tokenized-pokemon-trading-cards\">Considerations and Risks Around Tokenized Pokémon Trading Cards</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tokenized Pokémon cards present unique risk-reward profiles.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Regulatory Environment</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The regulatory landscape remains evolving, with the SEC maintaining that \"tokenized securities are still securities\" subject to federal oversight. Most tokenized collectible offerings likely qualify as securities under existing frameworks, requiring proper registration or applicable exemptions.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Intellectual property considerations add complexity, as The Pokémon Company maintains strict control over Pokémon trademarks and generally prohibits commercial use of their intellectual property without explicit licensing agreements.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Technology and Operational Risks</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Platform concentration risk emerges from the centralized nature of physical custody, creating single points of failure where operational issues, security breaches, or regulatory actions could affect all tokenized assets.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Market Dynamics</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Volatility</strong>: Token prices can experience significant fluctuations driven by speculation, limited liquidity, and broader crypto market sentiment rather than underlying collectible values.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Market Manipulation</strong>: Low liquidity in specialized segments creates susceptibility to coordinated manipulation, though traditional market benchmarks provide some price anchoring.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Platform Sustainability</strong>: The emerging nature of tokenized collectibles creates platform mortality risks, particularly during market downturns when user activity and revenue may decline substantially.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The tokenized Pokémon cards market represents an innovative application of blockchain technology to traditional collectibles, offering enhanced functionality while introducing new risk categories. As regulatory frameworks develop and technology matures, this sector may serve as a model for broader tokenization of physical assets across various categories.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The continued evolution of this market will depend on successful navigation of regulatory requirements, maintenance of robust security standards, and development of sustainable business models balancing innovation with participant protection.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>This article is only for informational purposes and should not be taken as financial or investment advice.

For developers, builders, and even those with limited coding experience, AI assistants have become powerful co-pilots, capable of accelerating everything from prototyping to debugging.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But while AI can dramatically speed up development, it's not without its challenges. This article will walk you through the modern crypto app stack, introduce the AI tools builders are using today, and shed light on the common pitfalls of building with AI. More importantly, we'll also show you how to overcome these challenges and build more reliably with AI coding assistants.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"understanding-the-crypto-app-development-stack\">Understanding the Crypto App Development Stack</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Building a production-grade crypto app is a complex task involving several interconnected layers of development stacks. Understanding each component helps clarify where AI can lend a hand.:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Smart Contracts</strong>: These form the backbone of a dApp, defining the on-chain logic and rules in languages like Solidity or Rust.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Frontend Interface</strong>: This is the user-facing part of the application, typically built with frameworks like React or Next.js, that allows users to interact with the smart contracts.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Wallet Integration</strong>: This component connects the user's crypto wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to the dApp, enabling them to sign transactions and manage their assets securely.

This data often comes from a comprehensive source like the CoinGecko API.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Integrating these layers requires significant development effort, from drafting architecture and writing boilerplate code to debugging and ensuring security. This is where AI assistants shine, acting as a development partner that can accelerate iteration across the entire stack, provided they are given clear instructions.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"ai-tools-to-build-crypto-apps\">AI Tools To Build Crypto Apps</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To navigate the complexities of the Web3 stack, most development teams now rely on a suite of AI tools. Here are the main categories:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>AI-Powered IDEs</strong>: Tools like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and WindSurf integrate directly into your code editor. Because they have the full context of your workspace, they are excellent for generating code, writing tests, and refactoring across multiple files.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>General-Purpose AI Assistants</strong>: Assistants like ChatGPT and Claude are perfect for brainstorming ideas, generating code snippets, and getting quick feedback on specific problems.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Cloud-Based Development Environments</strong>: Platforms like Replit and Google Firebase Studio offer collaborative, browser-based environments that are great for rapid prototyping without complex local setup.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Terminal Enhancements</strong>: Shell-native copilots like Warp AI or Fig.dev autocomplete commands, and write scripts to streamline deployment and management tasks.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While these AI tools can dramatically accelerate development, they're not a flawless solution. The core challenge lies in their reliability. Without proper guidance, AI assistants can introduce bugs, security vulnerabilities, and integration problems that end up costing more time than they save.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"challenges-of-building-crypto-apps-with-ai\">Challenges of Building Crypto Apps with AI</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">AI speeds up development, but makes mistakes without proper guidance.</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>General AI Errors</strong>: Models occasionally hallucinate unsupported features, skip validations, alter existing code, or introduce subtle bugs.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Struggles With API Integrations</strong>: This problem is even more apparent when it comes to API integrations. Crypto apps depend on real-time data from external sources, but AI models often lack up-to-date knowledge of third-party APIs. This leads to common mistakes, such as:</p>\n\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Using Outdated Endpoints or Libraries:</strong> An AI might generate code that calls a deprecated version of an API, causing the application to fail.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Exposing Sensitive Keys:</strong> A frequent and dangerous mistake is hardcoding API keys directly into the source code. This poses a major security risk, as the keys can be easily exposed if the code is shared publicly.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Implementing Incorrect Error Handling:</strong> Instead of using documented best practices for things like rate limits and retries, AI often produces brittle, custom logic that is prone to failure.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t\t<li aria-level=\"2\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>Hallucinating API Structures:</strong> AI assistants often make guesses for API request formats or parameter field names, leading to frustrating errors that are difficult to debug.</p>\n\t\t</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">AI output quality depends on the input prompts provided. Without an effective prompt, you'll spend more time fixing bugs than you save. The solution is giving AI assistants clear and structured prompts so they follow the right instructions.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"what-is-the-best-way-to-use-ai-for-crypto-development\">What Is the Best Way To Use AI for Crypto Development?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most reliable way to use an AI assistant for development is by giving it a clear, structured set of expert-written instructions, often called an AI Prompt. These prompts act as a guide, instructing the model on exactly how to use a specific tool or API correctly.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, when working with integrating crypto market data, you can use <a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/docs/ai-prompts\" target=\"_blank\">CoinGecko's AI Prompts</a>. These are pre-written instructions that you provide to your AI assistant to ensure it uses the official CoinGecko API and SDKs according to best practices.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Here’s an example of how a structured prompt snippet looks like:</strong></p>\n<p>Using a well-crafted prompt offers several benefits:</p>\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<li>\n<strong>Fewer Errors</strong>: It prevents the AI from using incorrect endpoints or outdated code.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Applies Best Practices</strong>: It enforces best practices like secure key management and robust error handling resulting in better security and reliability.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Faster Development</strong>: By providing a reliable foundation, it allows the AI to avoid common mistakes, saving you countless hours of debugging.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"example-of-using-ai-prompts-for-building-crypto-apps\">Example Of Using AI Prompts For Building Crypto Apps</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Putting the idea into practice is straightforward. A developer simply provides the CoinGecko AI Prompt to their coding assistant as context, then describes in plain English the project they want to build.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For example, we tasked an AI assistant with building a simple Streamlit dashboard to highlight currently popular coins and provide a quick price overview. The AI generated the Python script, the Streamlit layout, and even the interface copy.&nbsp;By using the CoinGecko AI Prompt as context and the specific build prompt (shown below), the resulting web app launched smoothly, showing live trending coins.</p>\n<blockquote style=\"background-color: #e8fcc9; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0; font-style: normal;\">\n\n\n<p style=\"margin-top: 1rem; font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.6; color: #34af00; font-weight: 500;\">“You are an expert Python developer. Using the CoinGecko API, build a Streamlit web app called ‘Market Movers’ that highlights trending tokens across different time horizons (24h, 7d, 30d) with prices in USD, percent changes, and links to the token pages on CoinGecko. Include a quick explainer at the top of the dashboard.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you're ready to try this workflow, CoinGecko provides official AI prompts for both its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/docs/python-ai-prompts\" target=\"_blank\">Python</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/docs/typescript-ai-prompts\" target=\"_blank\">TypeScript</a> SDKs, which are regularly updated with the latest releases.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"building-crypto-bots-and-agents-using-ai\">Building Crypto Bots and Agents Using AI</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To build crypto chatbots or AI agents, you can use the <strong>CoinGecko Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) Server</strong>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/docs/mcp-server\" target=\"_blank\">CoinGecko MCP Server</a> is a specialized tool that acts as a bridge, allowing an AI agent or LLM (like Claude or ChatGPT) to directly query CoinGecko's live market data using natural language.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It's important to understand the difference between the two AI tools CoinGecko offers:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>AI Prompts</strong> help an AI write code for your application. You use them to build a new script, dashboard, or bot from scratch.</p>\n\t</li>\n\t<li aria-level=\"1\" dir=\"ltr\">\n\t<p dir=\"ltr\" role=\"presentation\"><strong>MCP Server</strong> allows a running AI agent or chatbot to retrieve real-time data to answer a user's questions dynamically.</p>\n\t</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While AI Prompts are for the development phase, the MCP Server is for the execution phase of an AI agent.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Check out the official&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/docs/mcp-server\" target=\"_blank\">CoinGecko MCP Server documentation</a> and our guide to <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/learn/ai-crypto-telegram-bot\" target=\"_blank\">building an AI-powered crypto Telegram bot</a>&nbsp;to learn more about practical ways you can implement it in your projects.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\" id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">AI has proven to be a powerful tool in accelerating crypto development, especially when paired with clear, expert guidance and instructions. Its effectiveness also depends on factors like model capability and the quality of context provided.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">By using structured instructions like CoinGecko's AI Prompts, you can steer your AI assistant away from common pitfalls, ensuring the code it generates is secure, reliable, and efficient. This approach saves valuable time on debugging and allows you to focus on building great Web3 products.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ready to start building?

Unlike traditional rule-based bots that follow static instructions, AI-powered systems can analyze complex market data, adapt to changing conditions, and identify subtle patterns that humans might miss. This has led many traders to explore building AI crypto trading bots to gain a competitive edge.</p>\n<p>In this step-by-step tutorial, we'll build a functional AI crypto trading bot in Python. We will use the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/api\" target=\"_blank\">CoinGecko API</a> for comprehensive market and on-chain data and an OpenAI large language model (LLM) as the decision-making core.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-an-ai-crypto-trading-bot\">What Is an AI Crypto Trading Bot?</h2>\n<p>An AI crypto trading bot is software that automates cryptocurrency trades by utilizing artificial intelligence to analyze market data and make informed decisions.</p>\n<p>Unlike traditional algorithmic trading bots, which rely on fixed \"if-then\" rules, AI bots can learn from data, adapt to new conditions, and detect nuanced patterns that rigid systems might miss.</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Dynamic logic</strong>: AI bots can dynamically adjust strategies by modifying the prompt, thereby enhancing testing speed and reducing iteration time.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>24/7 operation</strong>: They run continuously without fatigue, monitoring markets around the clock.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>No emotions</strong>: Trades are based on analysis rather than fear or greed, reducing impulsive errors.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Handling complex variables</strong>: Beyond basic indicators like RSI or MACD, they can incorporate diverse factors such as on-chain metrics, sentiment, or emerging trends for more informed strategies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-an-ai-trading-bot-work\">How Does an AI Trading Bot Work?</h2>\n<p>AI trading bots work by ingesting market data and using an AI engine to evaluate it for trade opportunities, in accordance with a well-crafted user prompt.</p>\n<p>At a high level, an AI trading bot's workflow breaks down into four main stages:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Data Layer</strong>: This stage involves ingesting real-time and historical crypto data from sources like the CoinGecko API. This may include any time series data.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>User Settings</strong>: This includes the prompt and any specific trading instructions, such as Stop Loss and Take Profit.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>AI Engine</strong>: Data &amp; prompts are ingested by the AI engine, which is typically powered by an LLM like OpenAI, to produce a recommendation.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Safety Checks</strong>: Hard-coded rules like Stop Loss and Take Profit are applied, along with additional safeguards such as CoinGecko's honeypot checks to verify liquidity pool integrity and avoid scams.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Trade Layer</strong>: The bot places trades based on the validated signal. For beginners, it is highly encouraged to start with paper trading to test strategies in a risk-free environment before deploying live funds on a CEX or DEX.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Data Access Layer (DAL)</strong>: Trades are stored locally for reporting purposes. The trade engine regularly checks if any order may be closed in accordance with the Take Profit or Stop Loss rules.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"prerequisites\">Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>Here’s what you’re going to need to complete this project:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>A CoinGecko API Key</li>\n\t<li>Python 3.11+</li>\n\t<li>An OpenAI API Key</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Obtaining a CoinGecko API Key</h3>\n<p>All endpoints used in this guide can be accessed with a free Demo API key. If you don’t have one, follow this guide to <a href=\"https://support.coingecko.com/hc/en-us/articles/21880397454233-User-Guide-How-to-sign-up-for-CoinGecko-Demo-API-and-generate-an-API-key\" target=\"_blank\">get your free Demo API key</a>.</p>\n<p>AI trading bots may make frequent data requests, and can cause the Demo plan's rate limits to be exhausted quickly. For production use or intensive backtesting, upgrading to a paid plan is recommended.</p>\n<p>For this project, we’ll be using the following CoinGecko API endpoints:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/simple-price\" target=\"_blank\">Coin Price by IDs</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-id-ohlc\" target=\"_blank\">Coin OHLC Chart by ID</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/coins-markets\" target=\"_blank\">Coins List with Market Data</a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/search-pools\" target=\"_blank\">Search Pools</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Obtaining an OpenAI API Key</h3>\n<p>To obtain an OpenAI API key, log in to your OpenAI account and navigate to API Keys under Organization.</p>\n<p>Click <strong>+Create New Secret Key</strong> in the top right corner and copy the key.</p>\n<h3>Setting Up The Project Environment</h3>\n<p>To get started, create a new directory for your project:</p>\n<p>Next, set up a Python virtual environment to isolate your project's dependencies:</p>\n<h3>Installing Dependencies</h3>\n<p>Install the required packages by creating a requirements.txt file in the project root with the following content:</p>\n<h3>Storing Credentials and Settings</h3>\n<p>Create a <strong>.env</strong> file in the project root to store API keys and trading configuration.</p>\n<p>Replace the placeholder API keys with your actual CoinGecko API key and OpenAI API key.</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n<strong>TAKE_PROFIT:</strong> The percentage gain threshold to sell and lock in profits (e.g., 20% above entry price).</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>STOP_LOSS:</strong> The percentage loss threshold to sell and cut losses (e.g., 10% below entry price).</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>ORDER_AMOUNT</strong>: The fixed USD amount to allocate per trade.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>MIN_VOLUME_24H</strong>: Minimum trading volume (in USD) for a pool to qualify as safe.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>MIN_RESERVES_USD</strong>: Minimum liquidity reserves (in USD) to filter out low-liquidity pools.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>MIN_BUYS_24H</strong>: Minimum number of buys in the last 24 hours to indicate genuine activity.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>PROMPT_TEMPLATE</strong>: Path to the file containing the AI prompt template.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Create a <strong>prompt_template.txt </strong>file in your project root. We will store our system prompt in this separate file, which will be referenced in our .env file. We will define the prompt's content later in the guide.</p>\n<p>To load your config, create a new file under <strong>/utils/load_env.py</strong>:</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-feed-real-time-historical-crypto-market-data-to-ai\">How to Feed Real-time &amp; Historical Crypto Market Data to AI?</h2>\n<p>You can feed real-time and historical crypto market data to an AI trading from a comprehensive data source like the CoinGecko API. This data is crucial for the AI to perform its analysis. The CoinGecko API provides a wide range of data points, including real-time prices, historical OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) candlestick data, market cap, and liquidity data, which are essential for building a robust trading strategy.</p>\n<h3>Fetching Data: How to Get Historical Data for Major Coins?</h3>\n<p>Under <strong>/services/services/coingecko_service.py</strong>, we’re going to define a <strong>CoinGecko</strong> class, with a method for each endpoint.</p>\n<p>Start by importing the required dependencies and define the constructor to include the CoinGecko authentication headers. Don’t worry about any types that you have not yet defined.</p>\n<p>Note: If you’re using the Demo API, you’ll need to change the self.root URL to <strong>https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3 </strong>and update the <strong>self.headers</strong> key to <strong>x-cg-demo-api-key</strong>.</p>\n<p>Next, add a new method to the class to fetch OHLC data by coin ID:</p>\n<p>To run this, instantiate the class and call the method with the desired parameters:</p>\n<p>This will return raw candlestick data, along with a timestamp for search entry:</p>\n<p>Continue by creating methods for the remaining CoinGecko endpoints, and nest them under the <strong>CoinGecko</strong> class.</p>\n<p>The following methods will enable our AI crypto trading bot to fetch real-time prices, identify promising large caps, and find safe liquidity pools:</p>\n<h3>Defining Data</h3>\n<p>Under <strong>/data_access/models/</strong>, we’re going to define the three main object types that we’ll be working with: <strong>Coin</strong>, <strong>PaperOrder</strong>, and <strong>PortfolioItem</strong></p>\n<h2 id=\"building-the-ai-trading-workflow\">Building The AI Trading Workflow</h2>\n<p>To build an AI trading workflow, the AI engine will ingest market data, paired with a carefully crafted system prompt. This prompt is vital for optimizing the bot’s performance, and its outputs should always be rigorously tested.</p>\n<h3>How to Craft an AI Trade Analysis Prompt?</h3>\n<p>Start by drafting a clear, structured instruction that tells the LLM to evaluate supplied market data and deliver a formatted trade recommendation.</p>\n<p>Prompt engineering is key here as it directly impacts how reliably the bot interprets data and makes decisions, turning a general-purpose LLM into a focused trading tool.</p>\n<p>Here's a solid prompt template you can use or adapt. Save it in your&nbsp;<strong>prompt_template.txt</strong> for your bot to load:</p>\n<h3>How to Code an AI Trading Logic in Python?</h3>\n<p>Start by building a service that can interact with your favorite LLM, send user and system prompts, and return an output.</p>\n<p>Create a new file under <strong>/services/openai_service.py</strong>. Define an OpenAI Class with a single method called <strong>get_chat_completion</strong>.</p>\n<p>Our code now has the basic building blocks for fetching data from the CoinGecko API and passing it to OpenAI for technical analysis.</p>\n<p>For this to be an actual trading bot, we need a service that can handle the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>Create a new file under <strong>/services/trading_service.py</strong>. Since our example illustrates AI trading in a safe, paper-trading environment, we won’t connect to an exchange API, and instead just return basic order information.</p>\n<p>We have also added a <strong>calculate_cost_basis</strong> method to track the position's average entry price.</p>\n<h3>Storing Trade Data</h3>\n<p>The final missing component is a service that can store and retrieve our trading data. This will be our <strong>Data Access Layer (DAL)</strong>.</p>\n<p>For this project, we will use local <strong>.json</strong> files, as they require minimal setup and allow us to get started quickly.</p>\n<p>Under <strong>/data_access/DAL/</strong> we’re going to define 4 different files:</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n<strong>Base_JSON_DAL.py</strong>: Base layer for reading and writing .json.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>coins_DAL.py</strong>: For operations on the coin object.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>orders_DAL.py</strong>: For operations on the paper_order object.</li>\n\t<li>\n<strong>portfolio_DAL.py</strong>: For operations on portfolio_item object.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Building The Logic and Running The Trading Bot</h3>\n<p>This is where we put together all the services that we’ve built.</p>\n<p>Create a <strong>main.py</strong> file at the root of your project. Inside, start by importing dependencies, defining file paths for our local .json storage, and instantiating the CoinGecko and OpenAI classes.</p>\n<p>Next, let’s populate our local database with initial coin data.</p>\n<p>Now let’s handle the buy logic:</p>\n<p>On lines 4, 5, and 6, we feed the OHLC data into our AI engine to generate a trade recommendation. Based on our prompt, the AI will return a '<strong>BUY</strong>', '<strong>SELL</strong>', or '<strong>NEUTRAL</strong>' signal. If the recommendation is not '<strong>BUY</strong>', the function exits early.</p>\n<h3>Creating Stop Loss and Take Profit Algorithms</h3>\n<p>Next, let’s tackle the sell logic. A sell is triggered only when either the Stop Loss or Take Profit threshold is reached.</p>\n<p>Finally, create an infinite loop so the bot continues to execute, look for new trade opportunities, and manage existing orders:</p>\n<p>All that’s left to do now is tweak your settings and run your script.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-mitigate-ai-crypto-trading-risks\">How to Mitigate AI Crypto Trading Risks?</h2>\n<p>Risk in AI crypto trading is managed through hard-coded rules that can override the AI’s recommendations. While AI excels at data analysis, it lacks the human judgment to account for all market nuances, making manual safeguards essential.</p>\n<p>Key mitigation techniques include setting firm stop-loss and take-profit levels, as we've done in our <strong>handle_sell </strong>method, and actively filtering out scam tokens. You can also avoid potentially malicious tokens by using data from CoinGecko API to check for honeypot flags or analyze metrics like liquidity and transaction volume.</p>\n<h3>How to Detect Scam Tokens Using CoinGecko API?</h3>\n<p>To detect scam tokens, you can use the CoinGecko API to analyze on-chain data and identify potential risks with the help of the <a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/pools-megafilter\" target=\"_blank\">Megafilter</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/search-pools\" target=\"_blank\">Search Pools</a> endpoints.</p>\n<p>The surge in new tokens amplifies scam risks, especially honeypots that trap investors via manipulated liquidity, plus other frauds exploiting lax oversight.</p>\n<p>For our implementation, we’re going to use the <a href=\"https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/search-pools\" target=\"_blank\">Search Pools</a> endpoint as it allows us to pass a search query, filtering by coin symbol.</p>\n<p>To add this check to your bot, simply modify the first 3 lines of your <strong>handle_buy</strong> function to include the new check. The AI will flag if no legitimate pools are found for your coin.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-backtest-an-ai-crypto-trading-strategy\">How to Backtest an AI Crypto Trading Strategy?</h2>\n<p>To backtest an AI trading bot across time-series data, the AI should generate a recommendation for each data point, using the full historical context each time. If the recommendation is to buy, log the price and timestamp accordingly. Start by fetching a long period of historical OHLCV data.</p>\n<p>Consider leveraging CoinGecko’s paid API plans for access to comprehensive data stretching back to 2013, unlocking deeper insights for your strategy. From this, you can compute the average return of the AI’s recommendations to evaluate profitability.</p>\n<p>Here is a fully working example of a backtest for the AI trading bot that we’ve built:</p>\n<h2 id=\"can-beginners-use-ai-crypto-trading-bots\">Can Beginners Use AI Crypto Trading Bots?</h2>\n<p>Yes, beginners can use AI crypto trading bots, especially with guides like this that break down the process into manageable steps using familiar tools like Python.</p>\n<p>That said, while this tutorial lowers the entry barrier for building one, beginners should approach with caution, as crypto markets are volatile and unpredictable.</p>\n<p><strong>Always start with paper trading to simulate strategies without financial risk, and recognize that no bot guarantees profits.</strong></p>\n<p>The primary aim is to learn through experimentation in a safe setup before gaining enough confidence to transition to trading on live exchanges.</p>\n<h2 id=\"do-ai-bots-actually-work-for-crypto-trading\">Do AI Bots Actually Work for Crypto Trading?</h2>\n<p>AI bots can enhance crypto trading by delivering data-driven insights and automation, though their success depends heavily on implementation and the quality of the underlying market data.</p>\n<p>They offer clear advantages, such as pivoting strategies instantly with a new prompt and processing multiple data streams for complex analysis. However, challenges like potential AI 'hallucinations' and incorrect recommendations are inevitable, so it is crucial to approach AI trading with a mindset focused on learning and continuous validation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"potential-future-enhancements\">Potential Future Enhancements</h2>\n<p>The current bot analyzes price and on-chain data, but you can extend its capabilities by incorporating social media or news feeds for sentiment analysis, giving the AI even more context when making trade recommendations.</p>\n<p>Another powerful addition is a reasoning journal, where the bot logs the AI's rationale for each trade. This data can be invaluable for refining your prompts and improving strategy performance over time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In this guide, you've gained practical skills to build an AI crypto trading bot: from setting up a clean project environment, to pulling in varied market and on-chain data via the CoinGecko API, crafting effective prompts for the AI's decision-making core, adding essential risk mitigations, and sketching out a backtesting framework to validate your setup.</p>\n<p>Remember, AI bots serve to enhance your trading approach. They are tools for augmentation, not a substitute for thoughtful strategy and oversight.</p>\n<p>Ready to go beyond testing? Consider upgrading to a <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing\" target=\"_blank\">paid API plan</a> with access to higher rate limits and increased call credits that are necessary for running a production-level AI trading bot or conducting large-scale backtesting.</p>\n<h3 class=\"tw-text-lg md:tw-text-2xl tw-font-bold tw-text-gray-900 dark:tw-text-white dark:tw-text-opacity-87\">\n  More Articles\n</h3>"
